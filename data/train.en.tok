well , hello .
I will just start .
and I wanted to ask you , what is on ?
we have to arrange three working meetings in all .
two of which have to be two day ones .
when would you have time for that ?
well , as for the one day one , if we want to fix that first , perhaps ,
Monday the eighth of November would suit me fine .
Monday ,
the eighth ,
is quite inconvenient for me ,
as I will be away the week after Saturday the sixth .
how about the week before , the first week of November ?
well the first is All-Saints-Day .
that may not be that good .
Tuesday , the second , would also suit me .
Tuesday would suit me fine .
that is , hold on ,
only in the afternoons .
that will probably be a bit difficult .
Tuesday , Wednesdays are bad for me .
I have got dates then during the day .
how do you feel about Thursday ?
no , I have to go to a meeting in Cologne then .
so that would also be quite inconvenient for me .
we will have to think of something else then .
maybe the week after , on Monday , the fifteenth ?
that would suit me perfectly .
shall we fix that ?
yes please , that would suit me .
if I may suggest a time of day ?
all day , so that we will get home earlier .
yes , sure .
anyhow we have settled that now .
okay .
then we also have to arrange a two day meeting .
I would suggest ,
Tuesday , the thirtieth , and Wednesday , the first , since the time before that is quite inconvenient ,
as we have just seen ,
if that would perhaps suit you ?
that would quite suit me .
so it is Tuesday , the thirtieth , Wednesday , the first ?
yes , I would say so .
we can do it like that ,
I will cancel my other dates for that time then .
right .
well , we also have to agree on the time of day then .
maybe at eight again ?
that seems to be an appropriate time .
well , I think , if we can make it , at eight on both days ?
would you agree ?
yes , absolutely .
wonderful .
fine , we have got that fixed that then .
and for the second one we have to work in another two days .
well , it is always a bit difficult over Christmas anyway ,
and in the second week of December I will be at a congress in Munich .
so we are left with the time between Tuesday , the fourteenth , and Wednesday , the twenty second .
how do you feel about that ?
you mean Tuesday , the fourteenth , and Wednesday , the fifteenth .
probably .
that would suit me , yes .
right , let us fix that .
so we have fitted everything in then .
okay , maybe at half past eight this time ?
thus we will always have it at the same time of day .
that will give us some routine .
you are right there , of course .
let us do it at eight o &apos;clock .
to also agree on the place , I would say , that I will come to your place each time .
yes , I am all for it .
I mean , why should I reject it after all ?
okay , let us keep it like that .
right , thank you .
thanks a lot to you too .
well , hello .
I am calling once more .
in fact I wanted to arrange two dates for May with you .
and make a suggestion right away .
in fact the very beginning of May right on the fourth would suit me ,
that is a Wednesday .
well , I am all in favour of that , as .
excuse me please , I did not quite get that .
do you hear me now ?
well , I was just about to say , that Wednesday suits me fine ,
and we can already fix that
so , it &apos; s Wednesday ,
would you mind , if I come to your place ?
no , that really suits me fine .
it is almost better , then me having to come to your place , actually .
and as for the hour ,
maybe at eight o &apos;clock again ?
yes , I think , eight o &apos;clock is fine .
wonderful , thank you ,
yes , I thank you too .
then I think , we should tackle the second one for May right away .
how about the week before Whitsun ?
just a moment .
that is very inconvenient for me .
no , I have to go on a visit to Leipzig then ,
that cannot be done unfortunately .
I would rather suggest , the time right after Mother &apos;s day , on Tuesday , the tenth .
that would be a week later then .
more or less .
a week later , you say ,
mind you I have got no time at all during the week from the fifth to the twelfth .
I was thinking of the week before Whitsun .
but otherwise the time until Wednesday , the twenty fifth would also be possible for me .
well .
no , as I said , the week before Whitsun is not possible for me unfortunately ,
the time up to the twenty fifth , Tuesday , the twenty fourth of May would suit me .
would that suit you too ?
that would suit me perfectly .
we can fix that , I think .
will you come to me this time then ?
yes , certainly .
I will do that .
and I would suggest at eight o &apos;clock again .
yes , that suits me fine .
yes , okay .
maybe we could also agree on a third date right away , for June .
and if I may make a suggestion right away .
Tuesday , the fourteenth of June would suit me fine for example .
if that suits you too , perhaps ?
unfortunately that would not suit me at all , as I will be on my way to Brunswick then , on business ,
maybe both of us are free some time then ?
well ,
Saturday ,
the eighteenth as well as Wednesday , the twenty ninth or Thursday , the thirtieth would suit me ,
and I gladly leave it up to you , which day suits you best then .
I think ,
if you like , we can do it right on Saturday ,
the eighteenth ,
we should have that settled then ,
and I will come round to your place then .
yes , of course .
wonderful .
I would suggest you come to my place , at eight o &apos;clock again ,
we should have that fixed as well .
right , that is okay by me .
that is clear then .
thank you .
hello , I am calling again
in fact , I would like to arrange a working breakfast with you for a weekend , that is Saturday or Sunday .
maybe you could suggest a day , on which you should have time for me ?
well , let me have a look ,
that is Saturday or Sunday .
well , there are quite a few Saturdays and Sundays on which ,
I have just discovered , the fifteenth , sixteenth would suit me for example or else the last weekend of January .
how do you feel about that ?
no , the fifteenth and sixteenth of January suit me fine too .
unfortunately , I have got no time at the end of the month .
but the fifteenth and sixteenth of January would really suit me fine .
okay , let us say meet on Saturday , the fifteenth at about nine o &apos;clock .
great . I could not agree more .
splendid .
well , apart from that , we should also meet during the week .
we still have to discuss some other matters .
well , I think we should hold at least two other meetings ,
how about you ?
do you have any special wishes concerning the day ?
well , special wishes .
I just do not have that much time then .
but to make a suggestion right away ,
the time between Tuesday , the twenty fifth of January , and Friday the twenty eighth would suit me fine ,
could we meet then ?
Friday , for example , would suit me
otherwise I will be at a congress in Dresden that week .
but Friday would be fine .
shall we meet at , say , two or three $ P- $ M for tea then ,
and then we will surely get quite a few things done .
excellent , thank you .
I would suggest we meet at three $ P- $ M .
that is one date fixed then .
well , okay .
I am always willing to oblige .
I would say we fix the other one for some time after the carnival ,
how about that ?
I would have time the week after , in fact , Wednesday , the sixteenth , to Wednesday , the twenty third .
no .
unfortunately , I have got no time at all during the carnival season in February
and there is a meeting in Hamburg immediately after it .
I could suggest the week before
the time between Monday , the seventh , and Friday , the eleventh of February , would suit me .
that in turn hardly fits in my schedule .
well , if it has to be February , it would be possible at the beginning of February at best ,
that is the first to the sixth .
but I am afraid you have got no time then either .
well , right . if needs be , I would agree after all .
in fact , I will be back on Thursday , the third .
I could well see you on Thursday , the third or on Friday , the fourth ,
if it suits you ?
how about you ?
we can well keep to three in the afternoon then .
well , I agree with you .
wonderful .
thank you .
yes , excellent .
I thank you too .
well , I think , time is pressing a bit ,
we should be able to arrange three working meetings for the following days ,
that is , one each day , I think .
maybe it would be best , to make it all at the same time .
well the afternoons would suit me particularly well .
how about you ?
yes , definitely .
well I am still free the whole day today .
above all , maybe you should make a suggestion for today ?
when it suits you best .
well , can not we meet today , say , after lunch at about two $ P- $ M ,
and I do not know about your plans for tomorrow .
I think , you said , you had no time tomorrow evening .
but maybe you have got time tomorrow afternoon until late in the afternoon
we could stick to that two $ P- $ M date then .
no , sorry , but that is too late for me , as I have already got other dates from four $ P- $ M on
and it would be a bit tight then .
maybe we should meet in the morning , as I do not know how long it will take , but we might take some time .
well , tomorrow would be excellent .
on the day after tomorrow I am completely booked up in the morning , of course , right until four $ P- $ M .
well , but tomorrow , as I said , we can reach an agreement , if we meet in the morning .
let us meet right at eight o &apos;clock .
then I would say , that is settled .
and if I may persist , the day after tomorrow you said , you had no time in the morning .
to tell the truth , I have got the whole day at my disposal , actually .
shall we meet at two $ P- $ M again perhaps , as we will today ?
well , as for me , gladly .
let us say today at two $ P- $ M , tomorrow at eight $ A- $ M , the day after tomorrow at two $ P- $ M then ,
and that is it for me .
wonderful .
all that suits me fine too .
thank you .
well , I thank you .
hello , a very good day to you .
I would like to offer you to arrange some appointments with me ,
in fact two two day and a one day working meeting .
well .
the first half of December until the sixteenth inclusive would suit me best .
I have got a congress in Munich in the middle of that half of December ,
but I would be free from the first to the sixth and from the fourteenth to the sixteenth .
the first to the sixteenth suits me too ,
I definitely will not be away then .
and I could also fix a date for the time from the fourteenth to the sixteenth with you .
then I would suggest , we meet right at the beginning of December ,
on the first and the second in fact .
sorry , the second and the third would be quite suit me for a date with you .
yes , that is okay .
maybe we could hold the second meeting right in the week after .
how do you feel about the sixth and the seventh ?
I could at best hold a one day work group meeting with you .
okay , let us hold a one day one then ,
and you suggest another date , for the two day working meeting .
I would have time on the fifteenth and the sixteenth of November .
that should be a bit difficult , as I am busy in the morning of the sixteenth of November .
would you be free some other time ?
I would also be free from the eighth to the sixteenth of November .
okay , I think , I will be able to postpone the thing on Tuesday ,
and I would suggest , we simply take Monday , the fifteenth , and Tuesday , the sixteenth of November .
however the problem is , that I have already got another appointment from two to four on Tuesdays .
so I could only offer you Monday .
I really think , it should be a two day meeting .
are you perhaps free from the fourteenth to the twenty second of December ,
or otherwise on the thirtieth and the thirty first ?
I could still offer the fifteenth and sixteenth of December .
after Christmas I will be out of reach until New-Years-Eve inclusive .
then I would suggest , we simply take the fifteenth and the sixteenth .
okay .
goodbye .
hello .
I would like to arrange three dates for mutual visits with you .
I suggest , we fix the first date right for the beginning of May .
in fact between the first and the second of May .
I could offer you the fourth of May then , as I will be away from the first to the third of May .
that suits me fine , as I will be away on a trip until twelfth again .
let us fix the fourth then .
okay .
I could offer you Wednesday , the twenty fifth , after Whit-Monday , for the second date in May .
that would suit me .
however I could offer you to do it on two days ,
on the twenty fourth and the twenty fifth .
and drop the date for the fourth then .
however on Tuesday I will be busy from eight to twelve $ P- $ M , so that only Wednesday would suit me .
let us just fix this one day appointment .
and in June the week from the thirteenth to the nineteenth would suit me best .
the weekend of the eighteenth and nineteenth would also suit me .
before that I will be away on a business trip to Brunswick however .
we could fix that date for the eighteenth then .
okay .
I will be at the $ I $ A $ A from the eleventh to the fourteenth of September .
maybe we can arrange an appointment for that time .
we can certainly do that .
I will be there from the twelfth to the sixteenth
and therefore I would suggest , we take the twelfth of September nineteen ninety four for a meeting right away .
that is okay .
hello ,
I would like to suggest another meeting in October .
it would suit me best in the week from the twelfth to the eighteenth of October .
yes , that suits me fine .
actually almost any time would suit me between the fifteenth and the twenty fourth of October .
let us just take the weekend then
and fix this date for the fifteenth and sixteenth .
so you think we should hold the weekend seminar on the fifteenth and sixteenth of October ?
we can hold it right then .
well , that really is practical .
and maybe we should hold the preliminary meeting for it on the Friday before .
I will still be away on Friday .
I would suggest , we hold the seminar on the fifteenth and sixteenth
and discuss it some time before .
what do you think , of holding it between the twenty seventh of September and the second of October ,
or on the fourth and the fifth ?
I could fit in a date on for the first or second of October
that is in the week from the seventeenth to the twenty second of October .
well , we can fix a meeting for the seventeenth immediately after that .
that is possible of course .
I have not thought of that .
I would say , let us just do that .
okay .
okay .
hello .
I would like to go on a tour of the most important German university towns
and I would suggest , we fix a preliminary meeting , provided you want to take that trip with me .
yes , that is a good idea .
the first half of July would suit me best .
that is also possible for me ,
I would suggest , we fix the preliminary meeting right for the third or the fourth .
the third would suit me better , as I have got a date from ten to twelve $ A- $ M on Mondays .
okay , let us take the Sunday before .
that is settled .
and after that I would suggest we best take the trip from Saturday to Friday , from the ninth to the fifteenth .
unfortunately I have already got a date for the fifteenth .
maybe we could bring the trip forward for a day ,
that is from the seventh to the fourteenth of July .
we can well do that ,
count me in .
and when shall we meet over a glass of wine after the the trip ?
I would say , we take it in a bit ,
and afterwards maybe in the first half of August , on the thirteenth or fourteenth of August .
I will be away on the thirteenth of August ,
but the fourteenth suits me .
then I would suggest , we meet over the said glass of wine and spend a pleasant evening .
hello .
I would like to suggest that we visit the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S in Stockholm together .
yes , that is a good idea .
however I will still be away on the tenth and the eleventh of March .
that is I would only be free from the twelfth on .
on the other hand I will be away from the ninth to the fourteenth .
only Tuesday and Wednesday , the fifteenth and the sixteenth of March would be possible for me then .
well , it will not make much difference to me , whether we take Tuesday or Wednesday .
I would suggest , we take Tuesday and fix that .
okay .
furthermore I would like to suggest a joint business trip .
I think , that would be useful for our work .
the time from the twenty fifth of March would suit me best again .
I would be free for almost a week .
I have a bit too much work to do until the twenty sixth of March .
and unfortunately I can not drop it .
but I would be free from the twenty seventh to the fourth of April again .
it would be nice if you were free some time then to take that business trip with me .
well , the time from the twenty seventh to the thirty first of March would suit me fine .
I like that .
count me in .
and on which weekend would you have time , so that we can write the report about that trip ?
two weekends would be possible for me ,
first the second ,
third of April ,
good Saturday and Easter Sunday ,
as well as the twenty third and twenty fourth of April .
I will still be away on Saturday , the second .
the weekend of the twenty third and twenty fourth would suit me better .
would the third and the fourth also suit you ?
it is a weekend as well , as Easter Monday is a holiday .
okay , as for me we can also meet on the fourth ,
okay , then I would say , that is it .
okay .
hello
I would like to offer you , to have a working breakfast with me ,
and a day of the weekend would suit me best .
how about the weekend of the fifteenth and sixteenth of January ?
I would suggest , we take the wonderful Sunday , the sixteenth .
okay .
furthermore I would be pleased ,
if we were able to arrange two further working meetings maybe over a cup of coffee within the working week ,
and therefore the Tuesday or Wednesday , the first or the second at the beginning of February would suit me fine .
I will be away on Tuesday and Wednesday .
I would only have time from the third on .
the third would not quite suit me ,
as I have got other appointments on that day which I can not call off .
and how do you feel about the time before the eleventh of February ?
that is bad again .
I would have time on Friday , the fourteenth though .
otherwise I am already booked up unfortunately .
that is why I would suggest , we fix the meeting for that Friday .
do you mean the fourteenth of of January ?
I mean the fourth of January .
but the fourth of January is a Tuesday .
the fourth of February perhaps ?
excuse me please ,
I was mistaken about the month ,
it is the fourth of February .
exactly .
yes , we can well do that .
that suits me too .
are there any further days , that would suit you ?
unfortunately not .
I will be away on a business trip until the fifteenth of February unfortunately ,
I would be free from the sixteenth of February on though .
however Mondays and Tuesdays are inconvenient .
the end of February would suit me best ,
that is from the twenty fifth to the twenty eighth .
I am terribly sorry .
as we have got considerable problems in fixing a date , since I will be away again at that time , I would suggest the time from the twenty eighth to the thirty first .
Friday , the twenty eighth might be best after all .
yes , that suits me fine too .
you can count me in .
goodbye .
hello ,
I would suggest , we meet for working meeting today ,
and I suggest , we do it from nine o &apos;clock to eleven o &apos;clock .
well , I am free the whole day today .
as for me we can meet from nine to eleven o &apos;clock .
thank you very much .
we could fix the second date right for tomorrow .
I will be away from four $ P- $ M on then though .
I suggest , we do it from nine to eleven o &apos;clock just like on the day before ,
that will give us a good rhythm right from the start
and does this time also suit you for the day after tomorrow ?
unfortunately not .
however I am only free from two $ P- $ M on then .
that is okay for me .
I suggest , we meet there at two and three $ P- $ M .
yes , all right .
hello , Mrs Schindel .
in fact two two day and one one day ones ,
and I would like to begin with the two day one .
how would Wednesday , the tenth and Thursday , the eleventh suit you ?
I am sorry , I am already booked up then .
that is not possible .
would the week at the beginning of November be more suitable ?
that week would suit me better ,
however not between the the third and the seventh of November .
that is too bad , as I have got no time on the days before .
that is bad .
how about the time later that week ?
well , unfortunately the time from the sixth to the fourteenth is absolutely impossible ,
and Tuesdays and Wednesdays are also bad actually .
there are other things
we have to consider December then .
how do you feel about the beginning of December ?
well the second and the third of December would suit me fine .
that is fantastic .
that also suits me fine .
I would say , we fix these two days .
wonderful .
how about a further two day working meeting .
it could be arranged for after the fourteenth of December .
the fourteenth or fifteenth of December .
would that suit you ?
not quite .
could we do it from the sixteenth to the seventeenth again ?
I am sorry .
unfortunately I will be away from the seventeenth till the end of the month .
Mrs Schindel , on the fifteen and sixteenth December perhaps ?
no , that is not possible unfortunately .
I have got no time on the fifteenth .
that is too bad .
how do you feel about the day of prayer and repentance in November ?
that is really wonderful .
let us fix it .
wonderful .
we should still have to arrange a one day meeting now .
that should be easy .
how did say you feel about the end of November ?
unfortunately I would only have time on Tuesday the thirtieth then .
unfortunately that is not possible , as I have got no time on Tuesday then .
that is a pity .
how about December ,
on the fourth perhaps ?
right , the fourth should be possible ,
immediately after our other meeting .
even though it is a Saturday .
I am sorry
it can not be avoided .
okay , let us fix that too .
wonderful , thanks a lot for this arrangement .
thank you .
hello , Mrs Schindel .
I am so glad you invited me to visit you .
excuse me .
do you still have time in May ?
if you like , we can start right on the second of May .
unfortunately I will be away until the fourth of May .
how do you feel about the fourth of May ?
wonderful .
that is settled then .
and I would come to you then ?
yes , that would quite suit me .
okay .
but I certainly insist on , you visiting me too .
when would it suit you ?
about after Ascension day ?
after Whitsun ?
well , I could offer you Whit Tuesday .
that is a wonderful time .
I am absolutely delighted .
I am looking forward to my visit to you .
and I am glad , you are coming .
you will have to come to me again , in order to arrange everything .
how could I turn down that request ?
what do you think of the middle of June ?
unfortunately I can not receive you between the ninth and the seventeenth .
how do you feel about the eighteenth of June .
you do not mind that it is a Saturday ?
we can as well do it on a Sunday .
we can combine the whole thing with coffee and cakes then .
would Monday perhaps suit you too ?
I am sorry .
unfortunately I have got no time then .
let us keep Sunday then .
that is quite convenient after all .
all right .
wonderful .
at your place ?
yes , for coffee .
I am really looking forward to it .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , Mrs Steinlen .
I am calling , in order to arrange a date for the visit to the $ I $ A $ A with you .
I am already quite excited and curious too .
when would you have time ?
basically it is only possible from the twelfth to the sixteenth ,
however , only from the twelfth to the fourteenth ,
sorry .
I am busy on the other days .
that is wonderful , as I have got time from the eleventh to fourteenth .
we could fix a date for the twelfth or the thirteenth .
right on Monday , the twelfth , would be rather convenient .
that would quite suit me .
let us just fix that .
and I must say , that we urgently need a meeting in October ,
and to tell the truth , that the beginning of October would suit me .
I can only offer you the fourth and fifth of October though .
the fourth of October suits me ,
however the time from the fifteenth of October on would also suit me fine .
right .
the time from the fifteenth would also be possible .
first of all there is the weekend of course ,
but the Monday after would also be possible .
I must say ,
if that is the way things are , if you have got the weekend from the fifteenth to the sixteenth free ,
we can simply fix the weekend seminar for then .
how do you feel about that ?
discussing the weekend seminar immediately before is an excellent idea .
yes .
that sounds very good .
that is , the weekend seminar would be on Saturday , the fifteenth , Sunday , the sixteenth .
it would be prepared by us at the meeting on the fourth of October .
yes , excellent .
that is a brilliant idea .
wonderful .
I am looking forward to your next call .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , Mrs Schindel .
you have surely heard , that we are planning a one week tour of the most important German university towns together ,
and I have also heard , that you are involved .
and it really would be great , if we could arrange a preliminary meeting first of all .
what would you think of that ?
well , basically , I certainly agree with it ,
and I think a preliminary meeting is a reasonable idea .
would it be reasonable ,
now that we are talking about reasonableness , to plan the week of our tour first .
yes , sure .
well , only three days would be convenient for me actually .
yes , go on .
one could fix one week from Sunday , the third of July , to Friday , the fifteenth .
yes , that would also suit me fine .
let us say from Saturday , the ninth , to Friday , the fifteenth .
would that suit you ?
I am sorry .
unfortunately I will already be away on the fifteenth .
how do you feel about Tuesday , the fifth , to Tuesday the twelfth ?
that would also suit me fine .
do you have a very tight schedule for the beginning of July ,
or are you by any chance free for one day then ?
well , I would only be free on the third and the fourth day of July .
how do you feel about meeting on the fourth of June for the preparation , and starting out on Tuesday the fifth already .
will not that cause problems with the trains ?
well I think , that can be solved .
fine . let us say the fourth .
well , and where ?
at my place , if you like .
wonderful .
at your place on the third .
that would suit me fine ,
and on the fifth we will start out on the great journey .
excellent .
fine .
but quite honestly ,
if we actually spent a whole week together , we should at least evaluate the whole tour afterwards , with a slideshow and over a glass of wine or beer .
that is an excellent idea .
maybe on a Saturday or Sunday ?
to tell the truth , August would suit me better actually .
I really would not mind Saturday or Sunday .
shall we say the Sunday before Assumption .
that would be the fourteenth of August ?
that is right
that is wonderful .
that is also a convenient time ,
we have got sufficient time in between .
excellent .
and all the slides will be ready by then too , okay .
I am delighted
I am looking forward to our tour .
wonderful .
see you on Sunday then .
goodbye .
goodbye .
I must say , Mrs Schindel ,
we will really spend a lot of time together this year .
as I intend to suggest , we go to the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S in Stockholm together .
how do you feel about that ?
that seems to be an excellent idea to me .
unfortunately my schedule is very tight for that .
that is , on which days would you have time then ?
only the fifteenth or sixteenth of March would be possible actually .
both the fifteenth of March and the sixteenth would suit me fine .
I would suggest the fifteenth then .
excellent .
besides I also have a five day business trip with you on my agenda .
I am really delighted at that ,
and I wanted to ask you ,
if we could fix it for the end of March , provided this trip is at your convenience of course .
well , the last five days of March could be just enough for it ,
from the twenty seventh to the thirty first .
I must say that is a wonderful idea .
that fits perfectly into my schedule .
that would be the twenty seventh to the thirty first .
wonderful .
right . I have put that business trip down .
you have put it down ?
how about formulating our report on the trip at a weekend ?
I am sorry .
it is good Friday and good Saturday , and unfortunately I have got no time at all then ,
I am sorry ,
I am already booked up then again .
the next suitable weekend after that would be twenty third and twenty fourth .
that would suit me fine too .
I am still free then .
then I would say , we should seriously consider that weekend .
for drawing up the report ?
yes , that would suit me too .
excellent .
okay .
see you in March .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , Mrs Steinlen .
I have just discovered , that we still have to get together to work
I would really like to hold a working breakfast with you .
would something like that be possible ?
a working breakfast is the latest thing these days ,
and I am certainly in on it at once ,
though I must say , that I would prefer a weekend , in other words a Saturday or Sunday ,
and I would like to ask you , how you feel about the fifteenth and the sixteenth of January ?
that is perfectly convenient .
that is just the first weekend of January , on which I am free .
would you rather take Saturday , or do you prefer Sunday ?
there are fresh rolls on Saturday ,
I would clearly prefer that .
I could not agree more .
shall we fix half past nine then .
excellent .
it is the working breakfast at half past nine .
I would suggest , we meet for coffee and cakes .
how do you feel about Thursday , the twenty seventh of January ?
I am sorry ,
I will still be in Dresden then .
Monday , the thirty first ?
I am sorry ,
unfortunately I will be away then .
Friday , the fourth ?
excellent . yes .
let us have coffee then
at your or at my place ?
at your place .
that is a Friday .
right , that suits me fine .
at four $ P- $ M , if you like .
wonderful .
only a second meeting is still missing ,
for coffee and cakes again .
I can assure you , I bake a very good cake
how do you feel about Tuesday , the twenty second of February ?
that suits me fine .
we can well take it .
at four $ P- $ M again then ?
excellent .
that is a fantastic time .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
good bye .
good bye .
hello , Mrs Schindel .
we have got so much work at the moment ,
that it can not be avoided ,
to fix three dates for the next three days .
at eleven o &apos;clock in fact , if you like .
that can only just be arranged .
you said eleven o &apos;clock , did not you ?
I said eleven o &apos;clock .
I am glad it suits you .
eleven o &apos;clock is excellent .
how do you feel about the same time tomorrow ,
would eleven o &apos;clock also suit you then ?
wonderful .
I must say , I really like that .
and then we should still need a third date for the day after tomorrow .
I would suggest the afternoon then ,
in fact at four $ P- $ M .
yes , there is still something free then .
that would be very convenient for me .
all right .
let us meet then .
have a nice day .
see you .
bye .
bye .
well , hello .
how are things ?
when are your dates for November and December nineteen ninety three ?
when can we meet for this two day long term appointment ?
well I would be free right at the beginning ,
the first week of November and the week of the day of prayer and repentance would be very convenient .
I have got sufficient time then .
well , as for me , I will already be at a working meeting in Cologne from Wednesday , the third on .
well ,
the time from Monday , the eighth on is inconvenient for me ,
as I will be on a business trip myself then .
let us just fix the first and the second then .
yes , that would quite suit me .
okay , let us fix that then .
shall we fix the second two day working meeting for December ?
that would give us some time to prepare some projects .
I thing that makes good sense .
when are you already engaged at that time ?
well I will be at a congress in Munich from the seventh to the thirteenth ,
and then around Christmas I will also be hard to get hold of , of course .
I will be away then .
how about the time immediately after your congress ?
maybe Wednesday , Thursday , the fifteenth , sixteenth of December ?
that would be perfectly possible .
that suits me fine .
then we can fix it for that time
would you like to come to us in Kiel ?
yes , that is okay .
I will come to Kiel .
that is no problem .
then I will have a hotel room reserved for you .
yes , thank you very much ,
that would be nice ,
and how do you feel about a one day working session ?
when would it suit you ?
Thursday , the eighteenth , after the day of prayer and repentance would be at my convenience .
that excellent .
I have also got time then .
would you perhaps like to come to Bielefeld then ?
I will take the early morning train and I will be there at about noon .
that is excellent .
thus we will have the whole afternoon for the meeting .
yes , fine .
we have got all dates then .
how about you ?
when do you have time for visiting one another ?
do you mean May ?
yes . though I must say , that I am already rather booked up in May .
I would be glad , if we could perhaps fix a meeting for the end of May .
that would not be bad in principle ,
but I have already got an official meeting at the end of May ,
in fact it lasts from the twenty sixth to the thirty first .
so I am completely booked up then .
would it be possible for you before that , right after Whitsun ,
or will you be away then ?
no , the time right after Whitsun would suit me fine .
however if we did no , that suits me fine .
Whit Monday still is a holiday ,
that is no problem .
however if we fix the meeting for Tuesday it will be inconvenient for me , as my schedule for Tuesday morning is already quite full
could we perhaps fix it for Wednesday the twenty fifth ?
yes , that would be excellent .
so far I have not got any commitments for that day .
okay .
then we can fix Wednesday , the twenty fifth .
it would be best in the morning again .
yes , that would quite suit me too .
and otherwise ?
maybe once more right at the beginning of May , after May day ?
okay , although I will be away for the weekend .
I will be back from Wednesday the fourth on
shall we perhaps take Wednesday again , as it would also fit perfectly into my schedule ?
does that suit you ?
yes , that suits me fine .
that is wonderful .
then there is only that meeting in June left .
when would it suit you then ?
well , I must say , that I will be on a business trip in Brunswick some time then
in fact from Thursday , the ninth , to Friday , the seventeenth .
but I am still free the week before and after that basically .
that is just when I have got no time .
that is ,
on order to arrange a meeting , we can only fix it for the very beginning or the very end of June .
how about another Wednesday
the twenty ninth in fact ?
that would suit me perfectly .
that would be very good .
we can just fix that date then .
yes , okay .
see you in Bielefeld then .
hello .
I am already looking forward to seeing you at the $ I $ A $ A .
when would you have time for a walk around the pavilions with me ?
well , I am also very pleased , that we can go there together .
Wednesday , the fourteenth or Tuesday , the thirteenth or Monday , the twelfth would be most convenient for me .
basically I would also be here on Thursday and Friday ,
but I have already got a tight schedule then .
well , the days , you suggested really are the most convenient ones .
Wednesday would suit me best , as I have not got any other dates on my schedule then .
and we will meet in Frankfurt then .
yes , okay .
we will meet in the entrance pavilion then .
that is fine .
but I think ,
we should hold a meeting in October , after we have been to the $ I $ A $ A .
what do you think of it ?
I think much of it .
when shall we do it ?
I will be away on holiday during the schoolchildren &apos; s autumn holidays .
the time from Monday , the seventeenth of October would suit me fine .
right , let us take Tuesday the eighteenth .
as I have got no commitments then ,
and afterwards I will take a trip abroad myself .
Tuesday is relatively inconvenient for me , as I have already got a tight schedule from one $ P- $ M on .
would Monday , the seventeenth suit you as well ?
yes , sure .
if you are already perfectly fit again after you holiday , gladly .
that will not be a problem for me .
I think , it should be possible to get the laundry done before that .
right , let us take Monday , the seventeenth .
okay , all right .
I will put that down in my diary .
we still have to work in a weekend seminar in between times .
when would it suit you best ?
well , that is bad , as my weekends are rather booked up .
what should be okay is
I will have to pass on this question for now .
by weekend seminar you mean Saturday and Sunday , do not you ?
well , we could take Friday and Saturday as well .
how about the first week of October ?
Saturday , Sunday , the first and the second ,
or does not that suit you either ?
we can hold the weekend seminar together then .
that is no problem at all .
shall we prolong it to three days then ,
from Friday , the thirtieth of September to Sunday , the second of October ?
Friday , the thirtieth , is bad , as I still have got some commitments in the afternoon .
I think that is a good idea .
thus we can start right on Saturday morning .
I think , we can do it like this .
from Friday , the thirtieth , to Sunday , the second .
I will put it down right away .
right . see you there then .
how do you feel about taking a educational trip together , now that we have worked together so often ?
I think that is a wonderful idea .
I would suggest , we go to east Germany then .
maybe Weimar and Dresden .
that is a very good idea .
the problem now is , that we have to arrange a date again .
when would it suit you best ?
it would be very convenient for me , if we took the first half of July for it .
I do not know , whether that would suit you too .
it does .
that would really suit me .
well , I would be available from Sunday , the third , to Friday , the fifteenth .
you can choose a week within that period of time .
maybe we could start out right on Monday , the fourth .
that is a very good idea .
and you think , we should stay on until Sunday , the tenth ?
yes , exactly .
that is what I think .
maybe we could take Friday , the first
no , I have got no time then unfortunately .
I would be available on Sunday , the third .
we could meet at my place for coffee and cakes
and talk the whole thing over a bit ,
if you like .
yes , that suits me fine .
we could as well fix the preliminary meeting for Sunday , the third then
and start out on Monday or better Tuesday , in case something still has to be done , until Sunday , or Monday ,
the eleventh .
yes , that is a very good idea .
that is really great .
what the time after that ?
I suppose , we will see a lot and we will certainly take photos .
shall we also hold a follow up meeting ,
at which we have a look at the photos and at which we can pass everything in review .
I would quite like that .
we have to consider however , that we first have to have the photographs processed and the slides mounted if necessary .
in between times I will be away briefly once more and at a fair in Hannover
I would not be available before August .
basically that is not a bad idea .
how about the time before Assumption .
the week before from Monday , the eighth , to Friday , the twelfth would suit me fine .
let us take Friday .
it is always a good idea to go out on a Friday , as you can sleep long on Saturday .
that is fine .
would you like to come to us in Kiel ?
gladly , I love your city .
then I would be very pleased , if you came on Friday .
all right .
I am very glad , we have been able to meet so often lately .
how about a joint visit to the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S in Stockholm ?
and it is usually always nice to do it together with others .
well what time would you suggest ?
basically I can give you only two to choose from .
Tuesday , the fifteenth on the one hand and Wednesday , the sixteenth of March on the other .
otherwise I am already booked up unfortunately .
then I would suggest Tuesday , the fifteenth , as it is always very troublesome on the last day .
there is always a particularly large number of visitors then .
I think , we can fix Tuesday , the fifteenth .
maybe we can meet at the hotel first thing in the morning .
yes , that would be quite convenient for me .
fine , let us meet on Tuesday morning maybe at nine for breakfast ?
yes , that is a very good idea .
at nine in a hotel in Stockholm .
maybe you can tell me at which hotel you will stay .
yes , I will let you know , where I will stay .
well , how about the business trip we are supposed to take ?
when can you best fit it into your schedule ?
the only possibility , I have , is only in April ,
from Wednesday , the twentieth on , in fact .
well , unfortunately I will still be on a business trip myself on the twentieth .
I would be free from Saturday , the twenty third , to Wednesday , the twenty seventh .
those are the only five consecutive days in April on which I am free .
yes , that would be convenient .
we can do it like that then .
it might not be that good , to fix the business trip for the weekend of all days ,
but we will sure find something to do somehow then .
right , the things you do for your job .
fine let us take
what days were suitable for you again ?
yes , that is okay .
I have already put that down in my diary .
however we have got a problem now .
we still have to write a report about that trip .
and I have to be at a fair in Munich from the twenty eighth to thirtieth .
and that is why April is fairly inconvenient for the report .
and you have got no time at all in March , have you ?
I do .
I have just discovered , that I am free for a few days at the end of March .
it would be possible for me from Friday , the twenty fifth on .
well , unfortunately I have got to force you to work at the weekend again .
I would be free from Sunday , the twenty seventh to Thursday , the thirty first .
that would make exactly five days .
I think , we should best take these days of the week
and in addition to that , we will take Saturday , the twenty third ,
and Sunday , the twenty fourth of April ,
we had originally fixed for the business trip , as the best date for writing the report .
yes , that is also okay by me .
we can do it like that .
I think ,
we will thus have enough time ,
to gather our impressions and to prepare something , so that we will merely have to write it down later on .
I quite agree .
I think , we can arrange it like that .
well , how about having breakfast together and settling the important and yet open questions ?
I would really welcome that .
I am only not quite sure , if we will manage , to arrange an appointment for January .
how about you ?
I would really prefer the weekend from the fourteenth to the fifteenth of January .
well , that would suit me fine too .
the fifteenth would suit me even better , as I will have to be away on business again before that .
I think , we could meet on Sunday , the fifteenth then .
just come round to our place for breakfast at about half past nine perhaps .
lest we should meet for breakfast all the time , we could also hold two working meetings within the working week over a cup of coffee and perhaps a piece of cake .
how do you feel about holding one of them in January already and fixing the other one for February ?
basically I am all for it ,
but I will be the one who buys the coffee then .
I do not need much persuading .
how do you feel about the last week of June ?
Tuesday , the twenty fifth and Wednesday , the twenty sixth ,
Wednesday , the twenty sixth , however , would suit me even better .
basically Wednesdays suit me better too
but just that one does not , as I will be at a congress in Dresden then .
I could only offer you Wednesday , the nineteenth or Tuesday , the eighteenth ,
and then it is actually inconvenient again ,
and otherwise only in February ,
once before , and once after the carnival .
I would prefer to fix the appointment for Wednesday , the nineteenth .
I will go away on the days immediately after that ,
but it should be possible all the same .
we could take Wednesday , the nineteenth .
that would also leave us a bit more time until February .
that is a very good proposal .
and what do you think is the better time for the whole thing in February ?
before or after the carnival ?
I do not know , how wildly you celebrate .
I am from Kiel , it is celebrated relatively little here .
I do not know , to what extent that is different way down in Bielefeld .
I think , it might be better to do it the carnival .
shall we perhaps look for another Wednesday ?
gladly , as I have got no other commitments than .
so I will be available the whole afternoon then .
that is a bad proposal though .
personally the second would suit me better , as I will be away celebrating in the Rhineland on the ninth .
I am sorry .
I will be away then .
would not another day within the working week suit you ,
such as a Thursday perhaps ?
yes , a Thursday would be possible .
Thursday , the third would suit me fine .
Thursday , the third , would suit me too .
let us fix that date then .
will you be at my place at about half past three $ P- $ M .
I could bring the cake this time .
but only if I may buy the .
sure .
well , we still have to come together again after all those working meetings and business trips ,
and I would suggest tomorrow , from ten to twelve $ A- $ M , for the first date .
tomorrow would suit me fine . as today I would only have time late in the evening .
yes , fine .
let us fix that for tomorrow then .
tomorrow at ten ?
tomorrow at ten .
all right ,
I will come to your office then .
would not you like to come round for dinner besides ?
it is always much nicer to hold a working meeting in a matey atmosphere
sure .
gladly .
when would it suit you best ,
at seven or eight $ P- $ M ?
I should say right at seven $ P- $ M .
yes , okay .
I will bring the bottle of wine then .
and I will see about the food .
but I think , these two meetings will not be enough .
we should come together a third time
and discuss the whole matter ,
although I am already quite booked up in the mornings then ,
how about you ,
do you already have any dates ?
no , I am still free the whole day after tomorrow .
maybe in the Mensa .
okay , I love to eat in the Mensa .
the food is just excellent there .
at one $ P- $ M please , if possible .
okay , that is no problem for me .
right .
see you in the Mensa at one $ P- $ M then .
menu two .
okay , but first it is this evening at seven ,
we will have something a bit more out of the ordinary then .
and as I said , I will bring the champagne or the wine .
okay , see you this evening .
well , a wonderful day to you .
this is Doctor M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt speaking
I am calling again about the two day working meeting , we wanted to arrange .
November would quite suit me ,
if we could fix it as a two day working plan for Monday and Tuesday , the eighth and the ninth .
nice of you to call , Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt .
that appointment is quite important for me as well .
I have got no time on the eighth and ninth of all days .
am I right in assuming , that you have got no time before that ?
but no , Monday , Tuesday , the first and the second have just caught my eye .
although All-Saints-Day would not be that good actually .
it is the Protestant North .
okay , but on the fifteenth , sixteenth if you like ?
that would be perfectly possible .
we could meet then .
okay , I am putting that down .
I would still be free after the day of prayer and repentance for the second one ,
that is Thursday , Friday to Monday the twenty second .
how do you feel about that ?
well , I will be away from Friday , the nineteenth on .
so Thursday , the eighteenth , would be suitable for a one day working meeting .
okay , let us fix that .
I could offer you the December for the second working meeting ,
in fact I have got time from Wednesday , the first , to Thursday , the sixteenth of December .
it should be possible to find something then .
you have got a nice Advent season .
well , I am free from Wednesday , the first to Monday , the sixth .
shall we take Thursday and Friday , the second and third ?
right , although I have already got appointments for Friday morning .
so Thursday would suit me best .
oh , I have just discovered , that I have got an appointment for Wednesday afternoon .
that is very , very inconvenient now .
just a moment ,
until the sixteenth , you said , I am free on the fourteenth , fifteenth , sixteenth in turn .
how do you feel about that ?
well , I would say , we take the fifteenth and sixteenth .
I would still have sufficient time for you then .
right , I would have to rearrange Wednesday afternoon then ,
but that should be possible .
yes , I have got lots of appointments then .
okay , let us fix the fifteenth and sixteenth .
yes , thanks a lot .
okay , I am looking forward to it ,
bye .
hello , Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt , this is Doctor Kl &quot; ubner speaking .
we should like to have two appointments for May with you , to discuss business matters .
I would like to ask , when it suits you .
right at the beginning or rather in the middle , around the thirteenth to the fifteenth ?
well I would still be free on Friday the thirteenth .
yes , that would suit me .
but otherwise , I have already got a visit to Leipzig the week after .
that is also something nice .
okay , let us just fix Friday , the thirteenth for now .
and then there should still be Tuesday and Wednesday , the twenty fourth , twenty fifth or also the beginning of the month .
yes , Tuesday and Wednesday , the twenty fourth and twenty fifth , suit me fine .
that would fit exactly into my schedule .
well I will just put down , that will be your turn then .
just a moment ,
Tuesday or Wednesday , we only need one more day .
or shall we fix both for Tuesday , Wednesday and drop the thirteenth ?
well I have got an appointment for Tuesday morning .
but that does not matter actually .
I think , we should take the Wednesday .
right , and keep the other appointment for the thirteenth .
yes .
okay .
now the thing is , that we should like to pay you a visit in June .
the week from Monday the thirteenth to Sunday , the nineteenth , would suit me .
from where are you calling , Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt ?
yes , I am sitting here in Kiel and I am busy with an important experiment .
but I think , there are also other days to be found .
Wednesday or Thursday , the twenty ninth , thirtieth , would also suit me .
fine .
I would also have time on Saturday , the eighteenth ,
but a weekend can be kept free .
the twenty ninth , thirtieth , you said ?
let us just take the twenty ninth .
yes .
I think , I will drop in on you then .
fine , thank you .
bye .
bye .
hello .
this is Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt .
can you hear me ?
hello , Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt .
Doctor Kl &quot; ubner speaking .
I can hear you perfectly .
what can I do for you ?
well , the thing is , we bumped into each other at the $ I $ A $ A last year .
and now I thought , we could go there together this year .
I was thinking of buying one of those smashing cars in two years time .
well , you have got plans .
but I would like to ,
I wanted to go there anyway .
well , when would it suit you ?
let me have a look at my schedule .
Monday , the twelfth , to Friday , the sixteenth .
are you free some time then ?
so we could meet there on the twelfth , the thirteenth or fourteenth .
I think , it is big enough for two or three days , is not it ?
shall we meet on Monday and see how we like then ?
yes , I think so .
everything seems to be going smoothly .
let us take Monday .
and meet in the pavilion in the morning then .
fine .
I have just discovered that we also wanted to arrange a meeting about the new distribution system .
when would it suit then ?
well I would like to get it over with as soon as possible , as the lads here just can not wait to complete the new operating system .
so Tuesday , the fourth , would suit us fine .
I think , we should take that day , if it suits you .
Tuesday , the fourth ?
no problem .
I will put that down .
fine .
I will come to your place then , okay ?
yes , that would be fine .
and we also wanted to hold a weekend seminar .
I think I am still free for one and a half week in September ,
that is from Monday , the nineteenth , to Friday , the thirtieth .
it should be possible to find a time then .
well , I am booked up on the only weekend unfortunately .
I will be in Dortmund then .
that leaves the beginning of October .
or right in the middle of October , the fifteenth , sixteenth .
or again on the twenty third , no , not then .
so it is the beginning or the middle of October .
well , both dates suit me .
I think we will take that date .
okay .
I will put that down .
in the old place in our seminar building , as usual , okay ?
yes , with a little coffee on the side ,
that is going to be funny .
the food is the best thing anyway .
okay , see you ,
bye .
bye .
a very good evening to you .
I am calling , because we agreed to plan a joint trip some time ago .
and I thought , this July or August nineteen ninety four might be fairly suitable .
how do you feel about that ?
wonderful idea .
how do you feel about some really beautiful German university towns ?
that would be nice .
that would suit me perfectly .
I really think , one should broaden one &apos; s mind on fields other than one &apos; s own field of study ,
and this can be done excellently at other universities .
exactly .
a whole week would be best ,
it will not be worthwhile otherwise anyway .
let me start .
July . lectures .
from the fourth to the tenth .
or the week after .
nothing in the following week ,
busy again the week after that .
when would it suit you ?
well , the fourth to the tenth , that sounds great .
we could meet for a preliminary meeting before that .
the weekend before would suit me .
I have only got time on Sunday .
that is probably a bit tight .
would the whole thing suit you a week later ,
from about the twenty fifth to the thirty first somehow ?
well , do you always have to pick the time , when there is the fair in Hannover ,
that really is inconvenient .
no , that would not suit me .
right , let us hold the preliminary meeting on the third of July and start out immediately afterwards .
that does not matter after all .
maybe we should call shortly before that , to buy the tickets .
everything takes quite long with the Bundesbahn .
but I will put that down , okay ?
from the fourth to the tenth of July .
yes .
I think so too .
well my wife will certainly want to come with us
and I think , she has already been very interested in this tour .
and she will prepare a few things in advance , so that we will not be too involved in the planning .
fine .
would you like to hold a little slide show viewing wine drinking back looking meeting together with my wife afterwards ?
oh , that would be nice ,
August would be ideal for it .
to let the summer end slowly ,
well that would be romantic .
the time between Monday , the eighth , and Friday , the twelfth , would quite suit me ,
I would be free sometime then .
well I was thinking of a weekend , as it is sure going to get a little longer in the evening .
the twentieth or twenty first ?
oh , I will be away then .
that is not that nice .
well if you prefer a weekend , how about Saturday the twenty seventh of August ?
I will be in Mannheim then .
that is too bad .
and you should have no time on the thirteenth or fourteenth ?
Sunday , the fourteenth would suit me .
that would be nice .
right , and we will swing the lead on Assumption day .
I think , we should take take Sunday , the fourteenth .
right . excellent .
see you .
bye .
hello , Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt .
the problems , no , the dates are calling again .
it is all completely booked up .
I heard , we are going to the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S in Stockholm together .
is that right ?
yes , I also wanted to do that together with you .
there is also a larger group , that planned to do that ,
but I think , we will be able to clear out , in Stockholm , for the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S .
I think , the dates are already fixed , from Wednesday , the ninth , to Wednesday , the sixteenth .
well I have got time from Saturday , the twelfth on .
how about you ?
unfortunately I am booked up until the fourteenth ,
but then I am free on the fifteenth and sixteenth .
I will start out on Monday evening ,
and then we will meet in Stockholm on Tuesday .
oh yes , that is very nice .
I can have a look around Stockholm on Monday then .
yuk .
well , I really like that ,
I am really glad , that
it is a pity , actually , that you will not see Stockholm ,
but maybe you have got a few free days after that .
right , now the thing is that we still have to arrange a five day business trip .
that is , I think it will take five days .
the only problem is , that I want to fix it for the time after .
in fact I have got a meeting in Kiel from Sunday , the twentieth to Thursday , the twenty fourth .
but I think , the following week would quite suit me .
well , I will not available from the twenty fourth to the twenty sixth ,
but I will be free from the twenty seventh , well say , twenty eighth , to shortly before good Friday .
right , good Friday is no good for a business trip .
so that is going to be a problem .
well I would say , we have to switch to April then .
so if we devote ourselves to our families on Easter Sunday and Easter Monday , I would say ,
from Tuesday ,
the fifth on .
well , I am already completely booked up then unfortunately .
I am still free on three days , the fourteenth to the sixteenth , and also on the fifth .
just a moment , from the twenty third to the twenty seventh ,
that would be five days .
well , that would be fine .
now the only problem is , that our bosses certainly want to have a report about this fabulous trip .
and I think , that I can not fit that in any more , as I will not be available on Friday ,
the twenty ninth ,
and on Saturday ,
the thirtieth .
well , the dates .
so we have to look even further ahead .
how about the time after Stockholm , from the seventeenth to the twenty third .
well , the time after Sunday , the twentieth , is very inconvenient .
I just have to attend the meeting in Kiel .
I really have to go there , otherwise the lads there will get angry .
that is getting quite knotty .
in my opinion , all that is left is the twenty seventh , until shortly before good Friday .
it will last only four and a half days then ,
but I do not see , how else it could be done .
okay , let us do it like that .
it is going to be a somewhat short good Friday this year then ,
but I think , it must be carried through like this in the world of business .
then we can also arrange something for the weekend .
the ninth and the tenth would quite suit me .
I will be in Berlin then .
shall we say , from the fourteenth to the sixteenth , or from twenty third to the twenty seventh ?
I would say we take the take the weekend on the twenty third and twenty fourth ,
as I am also booked up before that .
not in Berlin , but it is going to be a nice trip all the same .
I think , we should take the weekend , on the twenty third and the twenty fourth .
fine .
and we can start the business trip on Sunday and hope that we will have completed it by Thursday .
well , I think , that should be possible .
well our bosses will be pleased ,
if it is scheduled to last only four days , it will cost them somewhat less money .
right . we should demand another pay rise right away .
okay .
see you .
bye .
bye .
well , hello ,
this is Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt speaking .
I would like to arrange a working breakfast with you .
mind you I think it is time , we did something like that again .
the last time it bore a lot of fruit ,
Saturday , the fifteenth , or Sunday , the sixteenth , for example , would suit me fine .
fruit and pounds , you should not forget that .
the fifteenth or sixteenth ?
that suits me perfectly fine .
the fifteenth .
shall we take the fifteenth ?
oh yes , wonderful , that leaves Sunday , the sixteenth , for other activities .
that is really nice .
right , and I think , a working meeting over a cup of coffee within the working week would be quite nice too .
Tuesday , the fifteenth , perhaps ?
would that suit you ?
I will be at a congress in Dresden then .
but I do like coffee ,
let us keep that .
I would be free from the twenty eighth of January on .
the twenty eighth .
yes , let us take the twenty eighth , as I will not be available on the twenty ninth .
so Friday , the twenty eighth , would be nice .
okay , and after that February would be possible for me ,
basically from the first to the fourth , and then from Ash Wednesday to the twenty third .
well I think , the third or the fourth , would be possible .
that would be rather convenient , as I will not be available on the other days .
let us just take the third .
Thursday is always a stressful day anyway .
let us get together over a cup of coffee on the third ,
and swing the lead in the evening .
how do you like that ?
that is nice .
that would suit me fine .
great , Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt .
see you .
bye .
hello , Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt ,
I would like to talk about our new product with you again .
it would take about one or two hours .
today would be best for me actually .
when would it suit you still today ?
oh , just a moment ,
I just have to ask my secretary ,
she has got my papers somewhere round here .
well , yes , here they are .
today , that would be excellent .
well I think , we will do it quite spontaneously
from about ten to twelve would suit me fine .
yes , I think , let us take the time from ten to twelve .
quite spontaneously from ten to twelve .
fine .
and lunch after that , okay ?
yes , exactly , you said it .
well , we should arrange yet a second appointment then ,
I think , we also need a little time for other business matters .
how about tomorrow morning ?
tomorrow morning would be quite nice .
I can fit that in .
that is possible .
what do you want to talk about with me then ?
yes , I think , well we plan to set up a new network in our department ,
and I think you are very competent in that ,
that does cut the costs considerably .
well , I have got sufficient experience with systems , that crashed .
I think , that is going to be a good thing .
well , shall we take ten to twelve again for tomorrow ?
yes , that is fine ,
I can sleep a little longer then ,
yes , ten to twelve is ideal .
right , and then I have yet another wish
concerning the inner departmental staff planning in fact .
the day after tomorrow .
I will be available from one o &apos;clock the day after tomorrow .
when would it suit you then ?
yes , that would be fine .
well I think , you should not eat anything before that ,
we will go together
I know a wonderful restaurant ,
and we will go there .
and then we will discuss it over a hearty lunch .
it can be done perfectly on the side .
yes , okay , shall we meet at one o &apos;clock .
yes , I think , one o &apos;clock will be possible .
well , I will just come to your office then ,
and we will take your company car , okay ?
yes , I think , I will get rid of the chauffeur ,
and then I will drive myself ,
I am sure it is going to be a wonderful day .
thanks a lot , Mr M &quot; uller-L &quot; udenscheidt ,
bye .
bye .
we have to arrange several appointments for November and December nineteen ninety three .
in fact two two day and one one day working meeting .
how about you ?
when would it suit you ?
on which days of the week are you free basically ?
I have to check that first .
well , I usually have appointments on Tuesdays and Wednesdays ,
but apart from that we could see how we can fit that into both our schedules .
as for me , I have always appointments on Tuesdays and Fridays .
in other words , you are booked up on Tuesdays and Wednesdays ,
so only the time from Saturdays to Mondays would be suitable for us ,
if I am not mistaken .
well , I think , I could drop the appointment for Tuesday occasionally , if it can not be avoided .
but otherwise I agree , from Saturday to Monday .
well , I might be able to drop the appointment for Tuesday too .
only Friday would be impossible for me then .
let us see .
how about fixing one of the two day ones for November ?
well , the Tuesdays in November might suit you , might not they ?
yes , maybe on Tuesday or perhaps Monday and Tuesday the eighth and ninth of November ?
no , that one is just impossible .
I have got absolutely no time then .
how about Monday and Tuesday the first and second of November ?
yes , that suits me .
I would suggest , we make Monday and Tuesday the first and second of November nineteen ninety three our first two day appointment .
yes .
we can fix it like that for now .
and now we still need another two day appointment ,
I would like to fix it for December .
yes , that is okay .
let us fix it for December then .
what is the situation then ?
as I can not drop my appointments for Tuesday all the time .
Sunday , the nineteenth , and Monday , the twentieth ?
well , I am completely booked up from the seventeenth to the thirty first of December nineteen ninety three .
I have not got a free day then .
in other words , the only days I have at my disposal fall between the first and the sixteenth of December nineteen ninety three .
well , that should be okay .
maybe we could take Sunday the fifth , and Monday the sixth then ?
yes , that is okay .
I have made a note of a two day appointment for Sunday , the fifth and Monday the sixth of December nineteen ninety three here in my diary .
yes , that is okay .
so we still have the one day working meeting .
if I am not mistaken , we are both available on Thursdays .
yes .
then I would suggest ,
maybe we hold a one day working meeting once again in December , on Thursday , the ninth nineteen ninety three .
no , I will still be at a congress in Munich on Thursday unfortunately .
I would prefer to hold it in November .
yes , that is fine .
let us hold it in November .
when would it suit you then ?
Thursday , the eighteenth .
yes , okay .
Thursday , the eighteenth , suits me too .
okay . fine , Mrs Pfaff .
goodbye .
bye .
well , hello , Mr Vollstedt .
we need some new appointments again ,
for May and June nineteen ninety four in fact .
I have just been told so too .
fine , what is on your schedule at the moment .
I could well arrange something then .
well , suggestions .
I am open to them .
well , Mondays and Thursdays are bad for me ,
how about you ?
well for me it is the Tuesday and the Thursday .
so we will have to see .
Wednesday and Friday would be possible days for us I think .
yes , so it seems .
I agree .
how about as early as Wednesday , the fourth of May ?
I was just about to suggest that myself .
fine , let us fix that for our first appointment straight away .
shall I come to your place ?
does that suit you ?
yes .
that suits me .
fine .
I am going away after that actually .
fine , Wednesday the fourth then .
I will come to your place .
well , okay .
now for our second appointment .
let us see , whether there is a free Wednesday .
Wednesday , he twenty fifth of May , how about that ?
yes , fine .
I am free then too .
I will come over then .
yes , fine .
okay .
Wednesday , the fifteenth of May .
fine . we still have to arrange an appointment for June , nineteen ninety four , if I am not mistaken .
how do you feel about that ?
that is , I can offer you Wednesday , the eighth , the twenty second and the twenty ninth .
well , unfortunately I am already book up on the first two days ,
but Wednesday , the twenty ninth of June would be okay .
let us fix that then ,
I will come to your place again , okay ?
yes , all right .
fine , see you on Wednesday , May the fourth , okay ?
goodbye , Mrs Pfaff .
well , hello , Mrs Pfaff .
my secretary has just told me , that we have to arrange a number of appointments again .
well , what about the visit to this year &apos; s $ I $ A $ A in Frankfurt ?
I am free from Sunday , the eleventh , to Wednesday , the fourteenth .
how do you feel about it ?
well , how long do you want to stay at the $ I $ A $ A ?
well , I think two days as usual should be enough .
so long ?
one day may suffice as well .
but okay .
I would be free from Monday to Wednesday , in any case .
you should be free from Monday the twelfth to Wednesday , the fourteenth ?
yes , exactly .
okay , two days , just to be on the safe side , so that we can make it all in our own time .
shall we fix Tuesday and Wednesday , the thirteenth and the fourteenth then ?
yes , that is fine .
I like that too .
well , then we also have to arrange a weekend seminar for us .
well ,
I think ,
that is going to a bit stressful if we do it still in September , after the $ I $ A $ A and all that stuff .
shall we rather arrange it for October .
how about your weekends then ?
I was just about to suggest that myself .
let us take these two days for our weekend seminar then ,
two days as usual , okay ?
fine .
then we only have to arrange another date for a meeting in October .
what would you suggest ?
well , I am always free from Mondays to Wednesdays .
that is I will be back from Wednesday , the twelfth to the eighteenth .
in the time from the twelfth to the eighteenth , I would suggest we take Monday the seventeenth .
is that okay ?
yes , that suits me fine .
I just have to make an objection .
I have just discovered , that my schedule is pretty booked up on Tuesdays .
we may have to postpone the $ I $ A $ A again ,
would that be possible ?
maybe to Sunday and Monday , the eleventh and twelfth of September ?
no , unfortunately I have got time on Sunday .
but I am free on Monday .
will one day really not be enough for the $ I $ A $ A after all ?
okay , we will only take Monday , the twelfth then , right ?
okay , maybe we should also have time on Tuesday morning ?
I would still be free then , you see ?
okay , let us do it like that then .
yes , that is fine .
yes , fine .
well , I do not know anymore , at what time our appointment for October is now .
Monday , the seventeenth , or when was it ?
we fixed Monday , the seventeenth for the appointment .
right , that is it for now , is not it , Mrs Pfaff ?
goodbye .
bye .
well , hello , Mrs Pfaff ,
our one week trip is due now , our tour .
how about fixing this trip for July or August in principle ?
when would it suit you then ?
well , I have got more time by the week in July .
it is almost the same with me .
I think , we should rather take July then .
however , we should have arrange the preliminary meeting right before that .
how do you feel about Friday , the first of July nineteen ninety four ?
unfortunately I have got no time then .
the next date possible would be
hang on .
how long do we intend to stay after all ?
from Monday to Friday , I guess ?
well , a week , the seven days we agreed on previously , I think .
I think , we could rearrange things ,
depending on when we have got and can find time in the diary .
well , I am only free again from Sunday , the third on .
maybe we could hold the preliminary meeting on Monday , the fourth , and take the trip from Wednesday to Wednesday .
well , that would suit me too ,
so it is Wednesday , the sixth of July for the preliminary meeting ?
no , Monday , the fourth is for the preliminary meeting .
I see , sorry
the preliminary meeting is on Monday , the fourth of July and then from Wednesday ,
the sixth ,
to Tuesday ,
the twelfth is the trip ,
right ?
yes , exactly .
right , let us do it like that , okay ?
that is from Wednesday the sixth , to Tuesday , the twelfth .
yes , and the preparation on Monday .
fine .
well .
the we only have to fix
oh , I have just discovered , that I have already got a two hour appointment for Mondays .
therefore it would be better to postpone it to Tuesday perhaps ?
that may be a bit tight , as we are to leave on Wednesday already ,
but maybe Tuesday , the fifth ?
when on Monday are you busy ?
well , in the morning .
that is between ten and twelve .
well , I could easily come round to you in the afternoon then .
and so we can arrange it all on Monday still .
yes , all right , okay .
let us keep it like that .
we only have to arrange our follow up meeting on Saturday or Sunday yet .
how do you feel about that ?
well ,
considering the fact that I will be away quite often immediately after the trip ,
I would suggest ,
we meet on the thirtieth or thirty first .
yes , I was just about to suggest that myself .
I would take the twenty first of July .
well , does that suit you ?
well .
yes , that suits me .
fine let us fix that then .
we just take July and leave out August completely and fix the follow up meeting for the thirty first .
okay ,
goodbye Mrs Pfaff .
hello , Mr Vollstedt .
we have to go on a trip together again .
right , so it seems .
well , my secretary has already given me several dates .
okay , I wonder what this year &apos; s $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S in Stockholm will be like .
I think , three days as usual should be enough .
I have got only two free days after all .
then it can not be helped ,
we have to take these two days then .
when would a trip to the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S suit you at all ?
well , unfortunately only on the fifteenth and sixteenth of March .
fine let us fix the fifteenth and the sixteenth for a trip to the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S in Stockholm then .
well , will not one day do as well ?
one day , inclusive of the journey there and back , and a through look at everything is going to be a bit tight ,
well , it really should be two days ,
I really have to insist on the fifteenth and sixteenth ,
otherwise I will not manage to get my things done .
okay . agreed .
well , how about our five day meeting after all ?
it is still due as well .
how about business trip , the five day one , we have to take .
is there still time in March ,
or shall we postpone it until April ?
I would say , that is quite a problem anyway ,
well , I am all ears .
when in May or April would it be suitable for you ?
well , we have to go away some time over the weekend , if we want to scratch up five days .
well , unfortunately it hardly looks better with me .
I guess , it can not be avoided .
well then , how about the time from Friday , the twenty fifth of March to Tuesday the twenty ninth ?
I will not be free then yet .
I would be free on Sunday , the twenty seventh at the earliest .
yes fine , from Sunday , the twenty seventh to Thursday , the thirty first of March nineteen ninety four .
let us fix that right away .
well , that is
okay , that would be possible , right .
well , fine , and then we should also have to write this nasty report about the trip .
we should have to get together for that at another weekend .
how do you feel about April ?
how about the twenty third and the twenty fourth ?
well , I would rather have it a little sooner .
how about the ninth and the tenth ?
no , I will be in Berlin then .
well ,
then the only days we have still got for the appointment are the twenty third and twenty fourth ,
if I am not mistaken .
I have already got other appointments for the others .
okay , let us fix that .
the twenty third and the twenty fourth for writing the report about the trip .
yes , okay .
all right .
goodbye .
goodbye , Mrs Pfaff .
hello , Mr Vollstedt ,
I would like to arrange some appointments with you once again .
well , that probably calls for a working breakfast , on a Saturday or Sunday .
let us have a look .
would you prefer January or February ,
how would you like it , Mrs Pfaff ?
that is all the same to me actually .
could you make a suggestion perhaps ?
then I can see , whether it suits me .
yes okay .
let us see then .
I am still free on both Saturday , the fifteenth and Sunday the sixteenth .
yes , so am I .
right , let us take Saturday , the fifteenth for a working breakfast , okay ?
no , let us rather take Sunday , the sixteenth , as I will be away until Friday .
okay , let us fix that .
fine then we still have two working meetings at tea time within the working week ahead of us
shall we fix them for February ?
how do you feel about that ?
yes , we can try that .
I will be here in the week from the first to the fourth , and in the week starting on the seventeenth
and yes , I have also got time on Thursday , no , Wednesday , the twenty third .
well , just then I am not available .
but I think , we could do something right at the beginning of the month .
well . unfortunately , I have already got appointments for Mondays and Tuesdays ,
but how about Thursday or Friday , the the third or fourth of February respectively ,
shall we already fix a date for then ?
I would have to insist on Wednesday or Friday then .
right , Friday , the fourth then , for the first working meeting , okay ?
yes , that is okay .
and in view of our overlapping schedules I would suggest the end of February in order to find a time for another working meeting at tea time within the working week .
how do you feel about the end of February ?
I am only here until the twenty third .
well , I will have to shorten my appointment for Tuesday by a few hours then whether I like or not .
how do you feel about Tuesday , the twenty second ?
well , I have nothing planned for then yet .
well .
let us see ,
as I said , apart from that I would also have time from the fifth to the eleventh of February .
all that would still be possible for me
and then again from the twenty fifth to the twenty eighth of February .
but your schedule is probably already full then .
yes , exactly .
at what time are you busy on Tuesdays ?
on Tuesdays I have got appointments from eight to twelve ,
unless we still fix the working meeting within the working week for January .
how do you feel about January ?
maybe on Wednesday , the twenty sixth or on Thursday , the twenty seventh or on Friday , the twenty eighth of January ?
I just can not see , why we should postpone it , as a meeting for tea really should not take that long .
why not take Tuesday , the twenty second ,
from three or two or half past one $ P- $ M on ?
okay . if you insist ,
let us take half past one $ P- $ M ,
on Tuesday ,
the twenty second of February nineteen ninety four ,
okay ?
right .
as for now , see you on the sixteenth of January for the working breakfast then , right ?
okay .
goodbye .
bye .
well , Mrs Pfaff , some dates are due again .
how about you ?
three working meetings are to be arranged for the weeks to come .
I would suggest ,
we do not arrange as long ones for this week as we did for the previous weeks . as most of the things are already settled , are not they ?
would you agree , that about two to three hours will suffice ?
yes , I think so too .
I would also already have a suggestion .
how about meeting in the mensa for lunch right away and making a working meeting of it ?
that is a good idea actually .
I would suggest from one to about four $ P- $ M , okay .
does that suit you ?
yes , that suits me fine .
fine , and how do you feel tomorrow ?
well unfortunately my schedule is already full from four to eight $ P- $ M tomorrow .
but to make up for that I am free before that .
well , let us do it right from eight to eleven $ A- $ M .
yes , fine .
I will put eight to eleven down into my diary .
okay .
fine , then we only still have to fix a date for the day after tomorrow .
again I would suggest , we probably tackle the matter early , and we will have it settled straight away .
unfortunately that is not possible , as I will be busy from eight to twelve then .
yes , right .
then I would say , we will have dinner again afterwards .
how do you feel about that ?
yes , that is a good idea .
and then again from about one to four ?
fine , okay .
let us fix that .
okay .
Mrs Pfaff .
see you tomorrow
see you soon for lunch in the mensa at one o &apos;clock .
okay ?
goodbye .
goodbye .
well , I would like to hold the one day working meeting with you on Monday , the eighth .
Monday , the eighth , does not suit me at all .
maybe some time during the week with the day of prayer of repentance ?
well , I would suggest another Monday , the fifteenth .
that suits me excellently .
okay .
could we perhaps also arrange a two day working meeting for the same week ?
yes .
that is okay .
I would suggest either Tuesday and Wednesday the sixteenth , seventeenth or the seventeenth , eighteenth .
either would suit me .
let us take the sixteenth , seventeenth .
very well .
I would like to arrange another meeting for December with you .
a two day meeting in fact .
another Tuesday , the fourteenth , and Wednesday , the fifteenth would be best .
that is okay .
well , I would like to hold the first meeting in May in the last week of May with you ,
explicitly , on Thursday , the twenty sixth of March in the morning .
that does not quite suit me .
I have got no time from the twenty sixth on .
maybe one or two weeks before that ,
are you free some time then ?
yes . we could meet on Tuesday the twenty fourth , perhaps .
that is okay by me .
let us do it on Tuesday , the twenty fourth , in the afternoon .
I would suggest , we fix the second meeting in May for the first half ,
in fact , for Wednesday and Thursday , the fourth and the fifth of May , nineteen ninety four .
the fourth of May would suit me fine .
fine , let us take the fourth of May .
would you still have time in the first week of June for a mutual visit ?
on , that is great .
I would suggest the first of June , on Wednesday .
unfortunately Wednesday does not suit me .
everything is okay on Thursday and after .
well , let us take Friday , the third of June .
okay , okay , let us take Friday , the third of June .
well .
I would say Monday to Friday for the visit to the $ I $ A $ A
I would be free any time .
well .
then I would like to meet you at the $ I $ A $ A on Monday , the twelfth of September .
that is okay by me .
then I would also like to arrange a meeting for October with you ,
in fact , I would like to meet you on the seventeenth of October , or alternatively on Monday ,
the twenty fourth of October .
either would suit me .
let us take Monday , the seventeenth of October .
right ,
and I would like to fix the weekend seminar for the weekend ,
Friday ,
the twenty third ,
the twenty fourth ,
twenty fifth of September .
the weekend after would suit me .
and after that not before the weekend a fourtnight later ,
that would be from the fourteenth to the sixteenth of October .
well , that does not quite suit me ,
but the weekend from the thirtieth of September to the second of October would fit nicely into my schedule .
let us do it like that then .
well , the preliminary meeting and the one week trip with you would suit you best in the first half of July .
that is wonderful .
that would suit me fine too .
and I would suggest right away the week ,
from Thursday ,
the seventh of July ,
to Thursday ,
the fourteenth of July ,
for our joint tour of the most important university towns in Germany .
that suits me excellently .
and the preliminary meeting on the Monday , Tuesday or Wednesday before perhaps ?
right .
let us hold the preliminary meeting on the Tuesday before , the fifth of July .
okay , agreed .
well , and I would like to hold that get together after that ,
in fact on Sunday , the thirty first of July nineteen ninety four .
yes , gladly . let us fix it like that .
okay .
well , I would say , we fix the meeting in Stockholm first ,
in fact , I would like to meet you in Stockholm on Monday , the fourteenth of March .
that would not suit me .
only Tuesday or Wednesday , the fifteenth and sixteenth , would be okay by me .
let us take Tuesday , the fifteenth .
agreed .
shall we perhaps take our five day business trip some time immediately after that .
that would not quite suit me .
I would suggest the end of March ,
from the fifteenth to the thirtieth of March in fact .
would the twenty seventh to the thirty first be possible as well ?
and I would also suggest , that we write a report about it .
in fact , a weekend would suit me fine ,
in fact in April Friday , eight , nine , ten .
unfortunately I have already got a business trip to Berlin on my schedule .
I would suggest , maybe good Friday , good Saturday , Easter Sunday ?
that is very inconvenient too .
religious holiday .
I would rather suggest , we agree on the end of April ,
in fact , the weekend on the twenty second , twenty third , twenty fourth , perhaps .
I have got no time on Friday , the twenty second .
I just have to check my diary .
would Friday to Sunday , from the eighteenth to the twenty of March suit you by any chance ?
that is absolutely inconvenient .
well ,
I would say ,
that as our trip will not be that extensive anyway ,
we could well shorten the weekend and take Saturday , the twenty third and Sunday , the twenty fourth of April .
that should be sufficient for us .
I also think , that we will make it .
let us agree on that .
fine .
I would like to arrange a working breakfast for Saturday , the fifteenth of January with you .
that would suit me perfectly .
and I would like to hold the working meeting over a nice cup of coffee within the working week after that ,
that is on Monday , the seventeenth , in the morning .
Monday mornings are inconvenient for me on principle .
do Tuesday or Wednesday morning suit you perhaps ?
Wednesday morning seems ideal to me .
Wednesday morning , on the nineteenth of January ?
gladly .
and we can fix the second working meeting for a Wednesday as well ,
and I would suggest Wednesday , the twenty sixth .
if it is to be a Wednesday , the second of February would probably suit me .
that does not quite suit me at all .
maybe we should rather fix it for a Thursday ?
Thursday , the third of February .
yes , that would be very good for me .
let us fix it like that .
well , you are free the whole day today ?
yes , I have got absolutely nothing planned so far .
it would be wonderful , to arrange a meeting for the evening hours , from six o &apos;clock on .
well , if you think , that three hours will suffice , we really can do it like that .
okay , let us fix that right away .
and I would also like to work together with you tomorrow morning ,
in fact we should rather do it in the early morning , from eight o &apos;clock on .
we can well do it from eight o &apos;clock on , if needs be .
yes , fine .
and then maybe another late meeting in the evening , the day after tomorrow , again from six o &apos;clock on ?
would that suit you fine ?
suits me excellently .
okay , see you later ?
see you .
hello , this Ina Wei &quot; spflug .
I wanted to ask you , when you should have time to hold the two two day meetings ?
yes , hello , Mrs Wei &quot; spflug .
the two day ones .
I would be free right after All-Saints-Day , on the second of November , and also on Wednesday the third .
well , the third is a bit inconvenient for me .
I have got a meeting in Cologne then .
I see , how about the fourth and the fifth then ?
well , I will be in Cologne from the third to the seventh which is why it is not possible at that time .
right , and I will be away until the fourteenth after that .
well , the fifteenth is fine .
so , it may be possible on the fifteenth and sixteenth .
yes , that is fine .
that is possible for me .
let me see again .
that was Monday and Tuesday .
the meeting would have to be over by two $ P- $ M on Tuesday then .
oh , I have just discovered that I have got no time on Tuesday from eight to twelve .
that is certainly a bit inconvenient .
in that case we should better take two other days .
are you free on the day of prayer and repentance perhaps ?
yes , but only until three $ P- $ M .
well , that are not two days , but one and a half .
maybe we should fix another time then .
how about Tuesday the thirtieth of November until Wednesday the first of December ?
well , that is bad , as I am already booked for a few hours then .
it would be better somehow , if we did it from Thursday to Friday or something .
yes , that suits me too
but no , that does not suit me again .
maybe you are free some time on Wednesday and Thursday .
yes , Wednesday .
but only after seven $ P- $ M then .
yes , it is the same problem with me .
my schedule is full from eight to twelve on Friday .
only a weekend may be possible then .
yes , maybe the weekend from the eleventh to the twelfth of December then ?
no , I will be at a congress in Munich then .
that is not possible for me .
that is a pity of course .
it would be good for me if we did it from Friday the third of December to Saturday the fourth of December .
yes fine .
but on Friday I am only free from twelve o &apos;clock on .
that is okay .
yes , fine .
we should best meet right at one $ P- $ M on Friday .
I would still be free for an hour then .
that is fine .
fine .
and the second two day meeting ,
that seems to be getting problematic .
right , I am just having a look ,
well , I have got no time on Thursday ,
Christmas Eve certainly is always bad as well .
well , I have got no time then either .
and the Thursday and Friday ?
that would be New-Years-Eve .
but we could finish some time around , say , five or so
and celebrate afterwards .
I am completely booked up on New-Years-Eve .
in fact , I am going away then .
that is unfortunate .
maybe Sunday and Monday , November the twenty eighth and twenty ninth ?
I will still be away on Monday and Sunday .
well , I would be free on Tuesday , the thirtieth .
and Wednesday , the first , was bad for you , was not it ?
would not it be possible for you some time in the first week of December ?
well , we already have got one then , have not we ?
well , I would at best be free once more on the following Sunday and Monday ,
that is , the fifth and sixth of December .
those are the only days on which I am free .
yes , that quite suits me .
yes , fine .
and as for the one day working meeting , we were talking about a time , when only one day was possible .
it was some time in November , the beginning of November .
maybe that was Monday , the eighth ?
Monday , no ,
I will be away then .
I have got no time then .
well , some time at the beginning of November would be fine , or on Monday .
well , I would be free again from the fifteenth on .
from the fifteenth on .
yes , shall we hold it right on the fifteenth ?
yes , that is fine .
yes , okay .
hello this is Sara Khojasteh .
I wanted to invite you for May day .
would you have time on the first ?
unfortunately I am already booked up then .
I will unfortunately be away until the third then .
I would be free after the holidays , on the fourth , at best .
Wednesday the fourth , you mean ?
yes , I mean , on Wednesday .
yes , that would suit me too .
would you like to come round to my place ?
yes , fine .
I will come around to your place then .
at about what time ?
at around four for tea ?
yes , fine .
hello , Ina Wei &quot; spflug speaking .
maybe you could come and visit me on Whit Sunday ?
yes , gladly .
yes , fine .
then I would say , also for tea , okay ?
yes , at about three , okay ?
yes , okay .
hello , this is Mrs Khojasteh .
could you perhaps spare me some time in June ?
I would like to invite you for dinner again .
maybe on Monday , the sixth ?
Monday , the sixth , is bad , unfortunately .
I will just be away then .
but maybe you are free on Corpus-Christi ?
yes , that suits me fine .
yes , fine .
we will have dinner together then .
well , I am free only in the evening then , okay ?
I have only got time from eight $ P- $ M on then .
yes , I am only free later that day myself .
I am also only free from four $ P- $ M on .
okay , let us meet at six $ P- $ M then .
okay .
well , hello .
this is Mrs Wei &quot; spflug .
I wanted to ask you , whether you have got time for a joint visit during the $ I $ A $ A .
well , I would have time from the twelfth to the sixteenth .
I will be away before that ,
and after that , on the seventeenth , I will be away again .
well , and I would have time from the twelfth to the fourteenth .
shall not we go from the twelfth to the fourteenth perhaps ?
from the twelfth to the fourteenth .
yes , fine .
well , concerning the weekend seminar ,
would you have time on , say , the first of October ?
the first of October or the second of October ?
well , let us go to the seminar together then .
I am free then .
yes , that is fine .
by the way , we still have to arrange a date for the meeting in October .
would not you have time on the day of German Union ?
well .
no I have just discovered that I do not .
no , I have already got another date then .
could not we perhaps hold it a day later , on Tuesday .
yes , that is okay .
okay .
that is it now , is not it ?
I am not quite sure .
hello , this is Sara Khojasteh speaking .
I wanted to ask you , if you should like to go on a tour of the German university towns with me .
I have already chosen a few towns .
yes , that would be nice .
you said , it would take a week , did not you ?
would not you be free at the beginning of July , perhaps ?
within the first two weeks of July ?
yes , that would suit me fine .
however , I would only be free from Sunday the third on .
maybe from Monday , so that we start out on Monday and come back on the tenth .
yes , that really is fine .
let us do it like that .
otherwise it might get a bit tight .
maybe we should rather start out on Tuesday then ?
yes , fine .
let us start out on Tuesday and hold the preliminary meeting on Monday .
that is surely a bit soon , is not it ?
but we can do it like that .
yes , we can do it like that actually .
I think so too .
on the other hand we could also leave a few days break in between .
I have got time until Thursday the fourteenth .
me too , actually .
let us rather start on Wednesday then .
and we will hold the preliminary meeting on Monday .
yes , fine .
we could do it like that as well .
from Wednesday to Tuesday , the twelfth then .
yes , exactly .
and would not you have time on Sunday , the thirty third of July , for a glass of wine ?
for a follow up meeting so to speak ?
yes , I do have time then , do not I ?
yes , I do .
yes , fine . we could fix some time around three $ P- $ M then .
yes , that is okay .
hello .
this is Ina Wei &quot; spflug speaking .
are you by any chance free from Saturday , the twelfth on to visit the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S ?
no , I will already be away on Saturday .
it has just occurred to me , that I have got no time to visit you at all ,
but wait , I do after all , from the fifteenth to the sixteenth .
let us do it on those two days .
ah yes , and as for the business trip ,
would you have time from Friday the twenty fifth on by any chance ?
hang on , let me see ,
no .
well I would at best
well the seventeenth to the twenty second might be fairly suitable .
no , that does not suit me at all , unfortunately .
that is a bit too soon for me .
I have got a meeting in Kiel on the twentieth ,
that is not possible for me at all .
how about from Sunday , the twenty seventh to Thursday ?
yes , we could do that .
really ?
yes , it is fine , really .
fine .
and then we still have to write a report on the trip .
would you have time at the weekend from the ninth to the twelfth of April ?
no , I will be on another business trip to Berlin then .
so that is not possible at all .
I would have time on good Friday and good Saturday .
those are public holidays , of course .
no , I have got no time on the holidays , unfortunately ,
at least not on good Friday and good Saturday .
otherwise , Easter Sunday and Easter Monday at best .
okay , shall we do it then ?
yes , I think , holidays are a bit like weekends , are not they ?
yes , and besides it is important for us to write the report .
right ,
apart from that I could only suggest the twenty third to the twenty fourth ,
as the holidays might be a bit inconvenient after all .
I have just discovered , that I have got time then too .
that would even be much better .
let us do that then .
yes , okay .
let us do it at that weekend .
fine .
hello .
this is Mrs Wei &quot; spflug speaking .
I wanted to ask you , when you have time for the working breakfast .
well , how about the fifteenth of January ?
yes , that would be fine .
will you come to my place ?
yes , I would say , at ten ?
yes , fine .
and would you have time for the one working meeting over a cup of coffee on Monday the seventeenth of January ?
yes , that is fine .
I will come to your place then , okay ?
yes , that would be kind .
well , but I am only free from two $ P- $ M on then .
I see , let me see .
unfortunately , I am only free until five $ P- $ M .
will four hours suffice ?
yes , I think , that will suffice .
what did you say ,
from two o &apos;clock or from one o &apos;clock on ?
two o &apos;clock would be better .
yes , fine .
it will only take three hours then .
we should make it within that period of time
yes , it will suffice as we will hold yet another meeting .
just a moment ,
let me have a look .
well , I would be free on Thursday , the twentieth , for example .
Thursday , the twentieth of January ?
that is bad for me .
I will just be away then .
when would it suit you better ?
maybe some time in February ,
on the fourth of February perhaps ?
yes , that would suit me .
let us do it then , okay ?
yes , fine .
hello , this is Mrs Khojasteh .
do you happen to have time for a working meeting tomorrow ?
maybe from about twelve o &apos;clock on ?
yes , but I am only free until four $ P- $ M then .
shall we meet earlier then ?
well , it would suit me from as early as eight $ A- $ M on .
that is too early for me .
let us say at ten $ A- $ M .
yes okay , let us do it from ten to four $ P- $ M .
yes , okay .
and today ,
do you have time the whole day for a working meeting by any chance ?
today ?
yes , the time from eight $ A- $ M to eight $ P- $ M would fit nicely in my schedule .
yes , that is fine .
it is okay .
and the third working meeting on the day after tomorrow ?
but we could do it in the afternoon as well .
from when on would you be free then ?
I am free from two $ P- $ M on .
yes , fine .
let us do it from two $ P- $ M on .
from two to about seven $ P- $ M ?
okay .
yes , Gro &quot; sheim speaking .
I would like to arrange three dates with you .
in fact , I would like to arrange a two day working meeting with you .
if it suits you , I am free from the eighth of November to the eighteenth of November .
are you free sometime then ?
I was thinking of Monday and Tuesday , the fifteenth and sixteenth .
yes , that would suit me fine ,
let us do it then .
wait , I have just discovered , that I would only be available in the afternoon on Tuesday .
would that suffice ?
I think it would not .
I have got no time from two to four on Tuesday afternoon .
I think , we can not take that day .
then I suggest Monday and Tuesday at the end of the month .
that will be a problem for me .
I will be away on the twenty ninth ,
only Tuesday might be possible ,
if you have time on the first on December we can meet on Tuesday , the thirtieth and on Wednesday the first .
Tuesday is bad again , Wednesday as well , as I have already got commitments during the day .
well , how can we do it then ?
I would still be free in December , from the first to the sixteenth .
are you free some time then ?
just a moment ,
Friday is a problem for me , as I have already got an appointment from eight to twelve .
would it also be possible after that ?
Thursday , the sixteenth and seventeenth ?
the sixteenth is the last day , that would be possible for me .
but you have already got an appointment on Wednesday the fifteenth , have not you ?
I have already got an appointment for the afternoon then .
that would be difficult .
well , how can we do it then ?
do you have time on the first and the second of November by any chance ?
that would be possible .
however , only half a day on Tuesday again .
right , you have got an appointment in the afternoon then .
no , in the morning .
well , that is inconvenient for me again .
as we also have to hold a one day meeting , maybe we should say ,
that we hold the one day meeting on Monday perhaps .
that suits me perfectly .
I will fix that .
fine , and now we have to see , for when we can fix the two day one .
just tell me , when you have time .
the days I am available for an all day meeting during the day really are Thursday and Friday only .
right , I would also have time on Thursday .
but Friday would be a problem for me again .
well , you are booked up on Monday , Tuesday , Wednesdays and Fridays .
well , I suggest we agree on a one and a half day meeting .
I would suggest Monday and Tuesday perhaps , as I would be available from twelve o &apos;clock onwards on Tuesday .
Monday , yes ,
however , I am booked up on Tuesday from two to four $ P- $ M again ,
have not you got time at the weekend ?
a weekend .
well , I would be free at the weekend on the thirteenth and fourteenth of November .
that is absolutely impossible for me , unfortunately .
on Saturday and Sunday , the fourth and the fifth of December ?
that is suitable .
fine . wonderful .
let us take that date for our first two day meeting .
now we still need one for another one .
how about the Thursday and Friday before New-Years-Eve ?
that really does not suit for me , actually .
I could still offer you Saturday and Sunday , the eleventh and twelfth of December .
I will be at a congress in Munich then .
that is absolutely out of the question .
I am sorry .
well , I can see that is going to be a problem .
you are also booked up on the thirteenth and fourteenth of November .
right .
how about Monday and Tuesday , the second and third of November respectively ?
well .
I have got a meeting in Cologne on the third of November .
that is going to be a problem .
and you also do not have two free days between the eighth and the eighteenth of November ?
I would be free from Monday to Friday .
but again only with limitations on Tuesday and Wednesday .
well , that in turn is a problem for me .
I would be free all day on Mondays , Wednesdays , Thursdays
but on Thursday afternoons and Friday mornings I have got an appointment .
so , in principle , only the weekends are left ,
but we are through with them as well , I think .
the I would suggest ,
we take Monday and Tuesday ,
the fifteenth and sixteenth and simply meet after twelve on Tuesday .
so , you are busy on Tuesday morning , are not you ?
right .
that could be a problem , after all .
well , at the moment , I can see no alternative to that .
then we have to keep it like that for now .
maybe we can arrange a meeting later on .
okay , all right .
well .
hello , Mr Gro &quot; sheim .
we are again expected to fix three appointments for May and June this year .
how do you feel about May ?
I would have time in May ,
from the fourth to the seventh , for example .
wonderful , then I would suggest , we put down Wednesday .
Wednesday , the fourth .
yes .
that is okay .
I will put that down .
Wednesday , the fourth
and after that the tenth to the thirteenth would also suit me .
I could suggest Friday then .
okay , let us do it like that .
Friday , the thirteenth ?
right , wonderful .
a meeting in June .
I can offer you either the one from the first to the fourth .
that would suit me too .
I would suggest Friday then .
fine , let us do it on Friday , the third of June then .
wonderful .
all right .
goodbye .
Gro &quot; sheim speaking
Mr Ulf , I am calling again because of our visit to the $ I $ A $ A in Frankfurt .
I would be free from the eleventh to the fourteenth .
how would that suit you ?
well , I would suggest we go there right on Monday .
would Monday the twelfth suit you .
yes , that suits me fine .
I will put that down .
right .
well , we still need an appointment for October , if I am not mistaken .
I could suggest a time between Monday and Wednesday .
Mondays to Wednesdays .
Monday , the seventeenth , Tuesday , the eighteenth , Wednesday , the nineteenth would suit me .
fine .
let us take Tuesday , the eighteenth then .
does that suit you ?
I would only be free in morning on Tuesday , the eighteenth .
but I think it should be possible .
I think so too .
it is no big deal .
okay , let us take that day as well .
Tuesday , the eighteenth , okay ?
yes , and I have just been told that we are to hold a weekend seminar together .
let us see .
how about you ?
the first and second of October , before the day of German unity ?
that suits me fine ,
yes .
let us do it then .
wonderful , bye .
hello , Mr Gro &quot; sheim .
as you know , we planned this joint tour of the German university towns .
I think , we still need at least one more date for a preliminary meeting in addition to that .
how about you ?
well ,
as far as the trip is concerned , a date between the third and the fifteenth of July this year would suit me .
yes , that would suit me too .
I have also got time then .
the last possible day for me would probably be the fourteenth .
maybe we should do it like this ,
we start out on the Thursday before the fourteenth , that is the seventh .
and hold our preliminary meeting before that , between the third and the sixth .
well , Mr Gro &quot; sheim , the thing is , that I have got appointments for Thursday and Friday .
I would rather drop Friday than Thursday , as I am booked up for quite a long time from one $ P- $ M onwards on Thursday ,
and those are dates ,
which I really should keep , whereas it would be acceptable not to appear on Friday .
well , the problem for me is , that I am not available on Friday , the fifteenth .
would not it be possible to postpone your appointment for Friday after all ?
it would not be a problem to postpone the appointment for Friday .
however , I could also suggest Saturday , the twenty fourth to Sunday , the thirty first perhaps .
although I would have problems fitting in a preliminary meeting before that
I would have to bring it forward for a week .
how about that ?
well that would not suit me at all ,
as I will be at the fair in Hannover from the twenty second to the twenty sixth .
right , Mr Gro &quot; sheim .
I think we will really , that is I , will really have to lower my sights .
I would suggest , we fix the trip for Thursday , the seventh , to Thursday , the fourteenth .
I will just have to drop that Thursday then .
yes , that is very kind .
let us do it from Thursday , the seventh , to Thursday , the fourteenth .
and when shall we hold our preliminary meeting then ?
maybe at the weekend , on Sunday , the third ?
that suits me fine .
I will put that down right away .
Sunday , the third .
the preliminary meeting on Sunday , the third .
what about the time after that ?
maybe we could meet on a Saturday or Sunday ?
well , after the trip I will not be available for another week .
how do you feel about Sunday , the twenty fourth ?
I will still be in Hannover then .
I could offer you the thirty first of July .
okay , that is quite a long time after the trip , but it would suit me too .
let us fix that date then .
all right .
goodbye .
let us do it like that then .
goodbye .
well , Mr Gro &quot; sheim .
Ulf speaking .
we are supposed to attend the fair , or rather the congress , in Stockholm together ,
that is a one week event , actually .
how do you feel about a Saturday or a Sunday this March ?
yes , that would suit me fine .
Saturday , the twelfth and thirteenth .
fine .
all right , we can fix that .
okay , let us do it like that .
we will go to Stockholm on Saturday , the twelfth , and thirteenth .
I would have time for the five day business trip from the twenty fifth of March on .
that would not suit me .
I would be free on Sunday at the earliest .
how do you feel about that ?
well , that is going to be difficult for me , as I have already got another appointment on good Friday , the first .
how about the time after Easter , from the fifth to the tenth of April ?
so , that is absolutely impossible .
I am sorry .
well , then I would further suggest the twentieth of April to the twenty fifth of April perhaps .
but that does not fit with the appointment at the weekend .
we still have to write this report .
maybe we could take our business trip immediately after Stockholm ,
from the fourteenth to the nineteenth .
would you have time then ?
I might have time ,
but hang on , the fourteenth and the nineteenth .
that would be on two days , on which I have got commitments for several hours during the day .
but I realize , that it is hardly possible otherwise ,
and I would suggest , we fix these days for our business trip .
I can see no other way at the moment .
fine , then we will do it immediately after Stockholm , from the fourteenth to the nineteenth , okay ?
excellent .
well , then we still need a date for a weekend to evaluate the trip .
no , we have already fixed the weekend , if I am not mistaken .
no , I think , we have to write the report at a weekend though .
that would be some weekend after the nineteenth them .
I would just suggest the twenty sixth and twenty seventh of March .
that is definitely not possible for me .
I am sorry .
how about the time right after the business trip , Sunday and Monday ?
that is going to be difficult for me , as I have already got an appointment on Sunday .
I think , we have to resort to April , Saturday Sunday , the ninth and tenth of April .
how do you feel about that .
that is definitely not possible .
I will be on a business trip then .
would Easter be possible ?
would you have time then ?
okay , then let us cut back on our family life again and fix that day . Easter Sunday and Easter Monday .
yes , fine , let us do it like that .
thanks a lot .
well , Gro &quot; sheim speaking .
I am phoning about the working breakfast .
we wanted to meet on a Saturday or Sunday .
I will suggest a day right away , in January .
would the fifteenth or sixteenth suit you ?
excellent , let us take Saturday , the fifteenth .
fine .
let us do it like that .
and then we wanted to meet within the working week for a working meeting at tea time .
on what days are you available in the afternoon during the week ?
in the afternoons it would be possible the whole week .
and Tuesday , Wednesday and Friday would be the days that are really completely free , depending on the length of the conversation .
but I think , basically , all days are possible .
well , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday ,
Wednesday or Friday , maybe we should look for a Wednesday or Friday .
I would just say , Wednesday , the twenty sixth of January .
that does not suit me unfortunately .
I will be at a congress in Dresden then .
I would suggest , Friday , the twenty eighth .
Friday , the twenty eighth would suit me fine .
yes .
let us do it then .
Friday , the twenty eighth .
excellent .
and then I would suggest Tuesday , the first of February .
unfortunately I have got no time then .
maybe in the week after ?
that is not possible unfortunately .
how about Friday , the fourth ?
Friday , the fourth , that would suit me .
fine , let us fix that .
see you .
okay , see you .
well , Mr Gro &quot; sheim .
we are supposed to arrange three appointments for the next three days .
how about tomorrow evening , at about seven or eight $ P- $ M ?
yes , that would suit me
hang on ,
tomorrow evening ,
oh no , I have got no time then .
I am sorry .
shall take the day after tomorrow , at seven $ P- $ M then ?
yes , tomorrow at seven $ P- $ M , would suit me .
let us do it then .
fine .
then I could suggest the day after , at , say , seven $ P- $ M ?
hold on ,
do you mean today ?
no , in three days time .
tomorrow then .
no , the last day , on which we are suppose to meet .
well , I have already put down the seven o &apos;clock appointment for that day .
oh , there must be some misunderstanding .
but that day suits me as well .
how about tomorrow ?
I would be free from eight $ A- $ M to three $ P- $ M tomorrow .
okay , eight o &apos;clock , I will put that down right away .
today I would be free from eight $ A- $ M to eight $ P- $ M , the whole day .
that suits me as well .
say at one $ P- $ M for lunch ?
yes , fine , let us do it then .
bye .
well , I suggest , we see about the date for the $ I $ A $ A first .
I will give you the days , on which I am free now ,
that is from Monday , the twelfth to Friday , the sixteenth .
well , I would suggest , we take Monday , the twelfth ,
I will be available the whole day then .
well , then there still is the date for a meeting in October .
I will just give you the days , on which I am free .
there is a long period , that may be suitable , from Wednesday , the twelfth to Tuesday , the eighteenth ,
although this is only partially true for Thursday and Friday .
the second long period lasts from Sunday , the twenty third to Thursday , the twenty seventh .
maybe you have got time on one of those days .
well ,
I would suggest we fix this meeting for Monday , the twenty fourth , as we also plan to attend a weekend seminar together .
as I said , I am free all day on Mondays .
how about Saturday , the fifteenth , and Sunday , the sixteenth for the weekend seminar ?
we should be free then after all .
yes , exactly , let us take those two days .
okay , we have got the dates fixed then .
all right .
Mrs Schulz , how do you feel about the working breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday ?
I would be free on the fifteenth or sixteenth of January or on the twenty ninth or thirtieth or fifth and sixth of February .
well , I would also be free on the fifteenth and sixteenth and on the fifth and the sixth of February .
I would say , we do it right in January .
on the sixteenth , Sunday morning ?
and when shall we meet within the working week ?
well , Tuesday afternoons are quite good for me , and otherwise also Wednesday , Thursday and Friday afternoons .
the week from the eleventh of January to the nineteenth would suit me best okay .
well , I have got no time from the eleventh to the fourteenth ,
but we should see then , whether we could probably meet on Tuesday , the eighteenth ?
well , I am able to be there at tea time in the afternoon .
fine .
and maybe we should meet once more in February .
when would you be free then ?
it would be possible from the third to the eleventh of February ,
although Mondays would not be that convenient .
well , maybe we should fix the third right away ,
that would suit me too .
yes , that is okay .
Mrs Vollack , it is me again , Mrs H &quot; olzer .
well , hello , Mrs H &quot; olzer ,
shall we fix a few dates again ?
yes , there are three this time ,
two for two days and one for one day .
yes fine ,
suggest something ,
and we will see , whether it suits me .
basically , I must say that I have to exclude Friday , as I have got no time in the morning then .
yes , fine .
okay , how about Wednesday for example ?
let us say , Wednesday the tenth of November .
well , the problem for me is , that I have already got something planned for Wednesdays from three to nine $ P- $ M .
so Wednesday is impossible , just like Friday .
Mondays ?
Mondays are all right .
I am afraid that is bad ,
but Monday , the fifteenth of November would be okay .
the eighth of November is impossible anyway , as it is today .
but I am also free on the fifteenth .
let us fix a one day date for that day .
that is fine , okay .
then I would suggest you make a suggestion for the two day session .
well , my problem is , that I have already something fixed for Tuesday morning and Wednesday afternoon .
the only time I am free for two days running is Thursdays and Fridays and maybe at the weekends , if you do not mind .
and I am also completely free on Mondays .
I am free on Mondays as well ,
that means that it will always involve a weekend .
that is Saturday , Sunday or Sunday , Monday .
as it will not suit me otherwise .
yes , okay , that suits me .
suggest something .
well , then I would say Sunday , December the fifth and Monday , December the sixth .
agreed .
right , as it worked out so smoothly , let me suggest the twelfth and thirteenth of December right away .
well , I am sorry ,
that is not possible ,
but what about the nineteenth and twentieth of December ?
unfortunately , I have got no time then
I would be free on Sunday and Monday at best .
anything else is impossible for me , as I am already otherwise engaged all the time from November the nineteenth to the twenty ninth unfortunately .
what shall we do then ?
that is a good question .
when else would you be free for a weekend ?
a free weekend .
let me see .
well , that is it .
I am not free on any of these days .
only the twelfth and the thirteenth would be possible for me .
I am sorry , Mrs Vollack ,
it is simply impossible for us to fix the two day session .
well , that is really not so good .
maybe we could arrange it so , that we somehow have a day in between .
perhaps Saturday and Monday or something .
well , I just do not know , whether they have to be consecutive days .
well , it might be better than no session at all , might not it ?
I should say so too .
how do you feel about Saturday the eleventh and Monday the thirteenth ?
December or November ?
December .
unfortunately , that is not suitable either .
how about Monday , December the twentieth ?
and you said Saturday would also be possible apart from that .
on the fourth of December if you like .
was your first one the nineteenth of December , as I am not free then .
yes , it was the nineteenth of December .
but shall not we see about the fourth of December first ?
does it suit you ?
that is the Saturday before our session on Sunday and Monday .
let us make it a three day one .
okay .
right , and then I will be away from the seventeenth of December until New-Years-Eve .
let me see .
how about November still ?
Monday the twenty ninth .
that does not suit me either .
well , I think ,
we could try to somehow arrange another date for the new year at the three day session .
I am afraid we will have to leave it at that .
yes , I think so too .
thank you very much .
not at all .
hello , Mrs H &quot; olzer .
this is Mrs Vollack again .
we have to arrange a couple of dates again ,
two in May , in fact ,
I wanted to visit you then ,
in May I have got time from the second to the fourth and from the thirteenth to the twenty fifth .
how do you feel about that ?
hello , Mrs Vollack .
well , I am rather booked up in May .
from the second to the fourth , I am only free on the fourth ,
and from the thirteenth to the twenty fifth I am only free on the thirteenth and from twenty first to the twenty fifth ,
that is over Whitsun .
well , how about the fourth of May ,
you said it suited you ,
and Friday , the thirteenth .
I have marked that ,
excellent .
then I would suggest , we have a nice cup of coffee together on Whit Monday .
I thought , we fixed the fourth and the thirteenth for May , and agreed to fix another time for June ,
or did I get you wrong there ?
not at all ,
sorry ,
you are right ,
we still have to fix one for June .
then I would suggest , we ,
when , did you say , you should be away , from the ninth to the seventeenth ?
yes , that is right .
how about Sunday , the nineteenth ?
yes , that is okay .
excellent , we have got all dates fixed then .
thank you very much .
fine ,
that was quick .
hello , Mrs H &quot; olzer .
this Mrs Vollack from Kiel again .
we wanted to go to the $ I $ A $ A in Frankfurt together ,
which lasts from the tenth to the eighteenth of September .
though I must say , that I have got no time on the tenth , the eleventh and the seventeenth , the eighth ,
are you free some time in between then ?
well only the time from the twelfth to the fourteenth of September overlap then .
so you should have time on the fifteenth or sixteenth ?
not on the fifteenth and sixteenth , but only from the twelfth to the thirteenth , that is Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday .
I see , well , that suits me fine too ,
which day shall we take then ?
how about Wednesday , the fourteenth ?
okay , fine .
right , then we still have to fix a date for October , for the joint meeting .
I have got no time from the fifth to the fourteenth inclusive , and from the twenty fifth to the twenty ninth neither .
I have got a meeting in Bonn then .
okay . how about the fourth , right after the holiday .
hang on , let me have a brief look ,
the fourth is Tuesday ,
I have got no time after one $ P- $ M then unfortunately ,
so the fourth is bad .
how about the middle of October .
you were free some time then , were not you ?
I would be free from the twelfth to the eighteenth ,
although as I said Thursday and Friday are always impossible .
well , I have got time from the fifteenth to the eighteenth ,
so only Tuesday is impossible for me then .
so we should have to do it on Saturday , Sunday or Monday .
well it might almost be better ,
to fix the weekend seminar then , as weekends comprise two days at once .
it might be easier , to hold it right at this weekend .
yes , I think you are right .
let us fix the weekend for the Saturday and Sunday , the fifteenth and sixteenth of October .
okay , that suits me .
fine , then there still is the date for a meeting in October .
shall we hold right after the weekend seminar , on Monday , the seventeenth ?
that is fine .
we have got it all fixed at once then and have three days running .
that is fine .
thank you very much .
not at all .
Mrs Vollack , we want to go on a trip together , that is to take a whole week .
I suggest , that is , I have got time from the first of July to the fourteenth inclusive
and after that I would have time in the last week of August , from the twenty fourth to the thirty first .
well , July would suit me too ,
I am free from the third to the fifteenth .
the third is a Sunday ,
let us just take Sunday the third
hold on , just a moment ,
from Sunday , the third , to Sunday , the tenth , if it is possible to meet more before that ?
well , maybe we should rather go away from Monday to Monday .
that is an excellent idea ,
I will put it down like that then .
okay .
yes and it would be quite nice ,
if we could meet some time after that , to pass the whole thing in review .
yes , say on Saturday or Sunday over a glass of wine perhaps ?
how do you feel about the twenty fourth of July ?
unfortunately I will be at fair in Hannover on the twenty fourth .
I could also offer you the thirtieth , thirty fourth of July perhaps ?
I have got no time on the thirtieth ,
but as it does not matter , whether Saturday or Sunday , let us just take the thirty fourth .
okay , fine .
excellent .
hello , Mrs H &quot; olzer .
we planned to visit the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S in Stockholm ,
only I have got a small problem there ,
it lasts from the ninth to the sixteenth of March ,
and unfortunately I am already booked up from the ninth to the fourteenth .
so that would leave only the fourteenth and sixteenth for me ,
what about you ?
I am free from the twelfth on ,
and therefore the fifteenth and the sixteenth would suit me fine .
how about Tuesday , the sixteenth ,
does it fit in your schedule ?
yes , it does .
only , Tuesday is the fifteenth .
sorry , let us make that Wednesday the sixteenth .
okay , that is fine .
so that was the visit to Stockholm .
we still have to arrange a business trip , which is to last five days .
well , the days in April do not suit me ,
but the twenty seventh to the thirty first of March would suit me .
when exactly did you say ?
the twenty seventh to the thirty first of March .
excellent , those are five days that suit me .
that is fine .
well , and now for the report about the trip .
I would say that a weekend is probably fine for it .
unfortunately , I have got a rather tight schedule after that .
except for the Easter weedend I have got no time at the weekends .
my next free weekend would be the twenty third and twenty fourth of April .
it is a pity , that it will be quite a long time after the trip itself ,
but it suits me too .
okay , let us fix that right away .
twenty fifth and twenty fourth of April .
okay .
excellent .
Mrs Vollack , this is Mrs H &quot; olzer speaking again .
hello Mrs H &quot; olzer ,
you want to fix some appointments with me again , I guess .
right .
something real nice for once .
we are to get together for breakfast , on a Saturday or Sunday ,
how do you feel about that ?
well , I would like to , in principle ,
and I would have time on the fifteenth and sixteenth of January , or no , hang on ,
the twenty ninth or thirtieth , then on the fifth or sixth of February and on the nineteenth or twentieth of February .
the only days ,
that agree with mine ,
are Saturday and Sunday ,
the fifth and sixth of February and Saturday and Sunday the fifteenth and sixteenth of January .
that is all the same to me , actually ,
let us do it in January .
okay .
fine .
two working meetings for tea during the week , sounds quite nice .
though I must say , that I have absolutely no time on Monday afternoons after five o &apos;clock .
well , just suggest a day .
well , basically I am free every afternoon .
I would suggest some time in January , in the week from the seventeenth to the twenty first .
on one of those days .
well , I would only be free from the seventeenth to the nineteenth .
let us do it on Tuesday , the eighteenth .
okay , what time shall we fix ?
four $ P- $ M ?
yes , that suits me fine .
yes , and the second appointment .
how about fixing it for February , on Wednesday the ninth , for example ?
unfortunately , it does not quite suit me ,
but how about Wednesday , the second of February ?
unfortunately , I have got no time then .
how about the end of the month , on Monday , the twenty eighth ?
but no , I said I have got no time on Monday .
Friday , the twenty fifth of February .
unfortunately , that is bad , as I will be away from Thursday , the twenty fourth on ,
I would have time from the sixteenth to the twenty third inclusive and from the first to the sixth .
are you also free some time then ?
the first to the sixth is bad , as we already have our working breakfast on the fifth , sixth .
but no , we do not , that is wrong .
but I will just be back from a meeting in Hamburg on Tuesday , the twenty second ,
we could do it then .
that is okay .
fine .
at four $ P- $ M again .
okay .
thanks a lot .
hello , Mrs H &quot; olzer , this is Mrs Vollack from Kiel again .
we want to arrange three dates for working meetings .
have you already planned anything for the next three days ?
well , I would be free today , on Wednesday too ,
but it is not possible for me on Tuesday from four $ P- $ M on unfortunately .
well , then let us fix the first appointment for today then .
it is almost three o &apos;clock .
shall start at four ?
excellent , that suits me fine .
you said , you had no time on Tuesday .
when was that again ?
I am not free from four $ P- $ M on .
shall we start in the morning then ,
maybe at nine o &apos;clock ,
we should have enough time then ?
excellent , then we will start at nine on Tuesday morning .
fine .
how do you feel about Wednesday ?
on Wednesday I will only be free from one $ P- $ M on ,
but all afternoon and evening long then .
that suits me perfectly fine , as I will be free the whole day long then .
how do you feel about three $ P- $ M ,
thus you can have lunch in your time after one $ P- $ M ,
and we could do it then .
right , that is fine .
thanks a lot .
hello , Doctor Berkemer ?
hello .
we have to fix two two day appointments again ,
and I wanted to ask you ,
if the second week of November would suit you , that is some time around the day of prayer and repentance .
how about the seventeenth or eighteenth ?
that is perfectly possible for me .
we can do that , right .
there should be the following possibilities for the second date ,
I will read all of them to you from my sheet now ,
namely the first of November , the eighth to the seventeenth of November ,
the thirtieth of November to the sixteenth of December . and no others .
well , we can take days from the thirtieth to the first of December .
that is absolutely possible .
sounds very good .
yes , wonderful .
and we can hold the one day working meeting in the first week of November then ,
that was possible , was not it ?
only on the first or the second though .
right , we can take the second then ,
that is possible for me .
all right , thank you .
thank you .
well , Mr Doktor Korn , it is up to us , to arrange two dates for May .
would it be possible , to do this for a visit between Wednesday , the fourth , and Saturday , the seventh ?
absolutely impossible .
that is , Wednesday , the fourth would be perfectly possible .
shall we take it ?
yes , possible .
furthermore I would be free between the tenth and the thirteenth .
Friday the thirteenth is perfectly possible .
we can take it .
and how about Friday the third , for June .
okay .
fine , possible .
Mr Doktor Korn , a meeting during the $ I $ A $ A would be necessary ,
however , I have got the problem ,
that I am free only between the Sunday the eleventh and Wednesday the fourteenth .
is that feasible ?
that is feasible ,
as from Monday to Friday , no , I have got no time on Friday ,
but I would have time from Monday to Wednesday .
it would be perfectly possible , to meet then ,
we could do that .
I suggest Monday ,
the first date is always the best .
Monday , okay .
well , we should get together in October then .
basically I am free at almost any time then ,
apart from the time between the fifth and the fourteenth and some time at the end .
how about Tuesday , the fourth of October ?
okay .
fine .
well , and I would have time at the weekend , on the fifteenth , sixteenth of October .
would be fine , yes ,
let us take that .
excellent .
Mr Doktor Berkemer ,
we still need an appointment of one week for the excursion .
I would offer you the time from Sunday the twenty fourth to the thirtieth of July or the first or second of August ,
does that suit you ?
no , that does not suit me at all .
all other dates are bad .
yes , I have been thinking of the beginning of July too .
that would certainly be feasible .
we could fit in a week then .
the only question is , how we fit in the preliminary meeting before that .
if we prepared on Sunday or on Monday the fourth we could go on the excursion from Wednesday the sixth to Wednesday the thirteenth ,
is that okay ?
sounds good .
let us do that .
so it is the preliminary meeting on Monday and the excursion from Wednesday on .
yes , that sounds good .
and what about getting together once again at the end of August ?
the end of August is very , very bad .
how about some time in August , say , the thirteenth or fourteenth .
rather the fifteenth .
I have got no time then .
and what about the thirty first or thirtieth of July ?
the thirty first , okay ?
yes , that is absolutely possible .
we will meet on the thirty first then , okay ?
exactly , that is settled .
Dr Korn we have got a problem
a joint visit to Stockholm would be possible between Saturday the twelfth and Wednesday the sixteenth .
are you free some time then ?
yes , the fifteenth or sixteenth would probably suit me .
let us do that .
the fifteenth .
yes , the fifteenth is fine .
the problem is , however ,
that we would have to arrange a five day trip as well as an appointment at a weekend then ,
actually I have only got one weekend free for that ,
that is Saturday , Sunday the tenth of April .
that means that everything else would have to be done before that ,
is that possible ?
no .
I will be on a business trip to Berlin then .
that weekend is not possible at all .
is there no other free weekend any more ?
no , unfortunately not .
we will have to cancel it then .
yes , I think so too .
what about the five day business trip we are to take .
would it be possible in the week immediately after Stockholm ?
when was Stockholm again ,
was it the fifteenth ?
it was March fifteenth .
no , that is not possible .
then we would have to do it on the fourteenth already .
no , that is too early for me .
how about Saturday the twenty third of April to Wednesday the twenty seventh of April ?
and when shall we hold the follow up meeting ?
you can hardly hold it beforehand , that is true .
oh well .
and what about from Sunday twenty seventh to , well , good Friday ?
how about Saturday to Thursday ?
that would suit me .
but that Saturday does not suit me .
that is , I could join you later that Saturday .
that would be possible
I have just noticed there is still another possibility ,
as I said , I will be in Berlin then .
that is not possible .
that is bad .
otherwise there would be those days at the end of March .
then I would have to come a day later , or something .
that would still be another possibility .
we would not have much time together , at the beginning at least ،
that is better than nothing .
I would say we should consider that .
let us get the weekends straight .
if we did it like this , I would at best be free on Saturday and Sunday the ninth and tenth , or on the twenty third and twenty fourth ,
each in April .
yes , the twenty third and twenty fourth are perfectly possible ,
that is , we can meet at that weekend .
all right , we shall do like this ,
and we will simply have to cut the trip short ,
it is not possible otherwise .
right , I will join you later then ,
that would be from Sunday to good Friday ,
and I will join you on Monday .
no , not until good Friday ,
that is not possible .
it would only be possible until Thursday .
okay , fine ,
see you on Thursday .
from Sunday to Thursday .
exactly ,
that would even make five days .
that would be possible .
Dr Korn , we need three appointments ,
how about meeting at a weekend .
in the morning , in fact .
Saturday , Sunday January sixteenth would be possible ,
apart from that , it is not possible in January
January fifteenth and sixteenth are possible ,
we can take either .
shall we say Sunday ?
Sunday January sixteenth is possible .
and how about the rest of that week ,
that is from the sixteenth to the twenty first .
can we meet some time in the afternoon ?
the seventeenth ?
that is possible too ,
mind you , on the seventeenth I am free only in the afternoon .
that would be okay by me ,
though before five $ P- $ M .
okay , shall we say from one to five $ P- $ M ?
that is a long coffee break .
that is very good .
how about Tuesday February twenty second for our second appointment ?
that would suit me too .
I am free the whole day , any time .
I am free from twelve o &apos;clock on .
okay , let us meet at one $ P- $ M .
okay .
Doctor Berkemer , what is the situation ?
what days or times would suit you ?
any time , in principle ,
except the day after tomorrow from four to eight $ P- $ M .
it is the same with me .
that is , I have got no time between eight and twelve in the morning on the day after tomorrow , but after that I would be free until four $ P- $ M .
I would refuse to make appointment for eight o &apos;clock anyway .
I am asleep then .
right , tomorrow at six $ P- $ M .
yes , possible .
the day after tomorrow at eleven o &apos;clock $ A- $ M .
yes .
the day after tomorrow at eleven o &apos;clock $ A- $ M .
it would be one o &apos;clock $ A- $ M then .
one $ A- $ M , okay .
okay , fine .
hello , Mr Piske .
Lange speaking .
I am calling you to arrange two or rather three meetings with you ,
in fact it is necessary for us to probably meet twice on two days , whereas one day should be enough for the third appointment ,
now , I would like to sort out with you when in principle we could meet for two days between November and December nineteen ninety three .
I myself am booked up on Tuesday morning and on Wednesday afternoon ,
so that we should concentrate on Mondays , Thursdays and Fridays .
how do you feel about that ?
just let me interrupt you briefly , Mr Lange ,
when was it on Wednesday ?
Wednesday afternoon from five to seven is bad for me .
okay .
and it is bad on Tuesday from eight to twelve $ A- $ M .
okay .
Tuesday between two and four $ P- $ M and Friday between nine and twelve $ A- $ M are bad for me ,
as for the two day meetings , I am afraid , we may have to consider the weekends if they are to last a whole day .
right , that would mean that we had to concentrate on the time between Saturdays and Mondays .
is that right ?
well , Saturday to Monday would be okay ,
and we could perhaps hold the one day meeting on a Thursday then
would that suit you ?
yes , that would be fine too .
fine . could you tell me on which weekend you should be free ?
I have time the whole weekend from Saturday November thirteenth until Monday November fifteenth .
and in December I would still have time from Saturday the fourth to Monday the sixth and from Saturday the eleventh to Monday the thirteenth .
right , Mr Piske , only the beginning of December is possible for me then .
that is the time from Saturday the fourth to Monday the sixth .
shall we fix Sunday the fifth and Monday the sixth then for our meeting in order to get something out of the weekend ?
yes , that suits me fine .
right , let us take these two days for a two day meeting then .
that is fine ,
and now we still need another day .
can you make a suggestion ?
yes , we still have to arrange a second two day meeting
I do not know , whether it will do to meet some time between Friday afternoon and Saturday perhaps
just a moment , Friday afternoon to Saturday ,
let me see ,
maybe on November the nineteenth and twentieth .
how do you feel about that ?
no that does not suit me .
I would be free on Friday November twelfth and Saturday the thirteenth ,
that is in the afternoon on Friday and the whole day on Saturday
then on Friday the third and Saturday the fourth .
on Friday the tenth and on Saturday the eleventh ,
each in December .
well , that is not possible , unfortunately .
I will be at a congress in Munich then .
no , unfortunately that does not suit me either .
I have already got another appointment then .
the thing seems to be getting a bit fiddly .
let us see .
say , when could we perhaps arrange something similar for Tuesday .
Tuesday afternoon did not suit you , did it ?
well , on Tuesday we could meet at four $ P- $ M at the earliest
and then I would also have time the whole Wednesday .
but you are only free until three $ P- $ M .
but maybe we will manage to discuss everything by then .
yes ,
it would be fine for us to have time for each other from Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning at least .
let us see , when it is possible November ,
maybe at the beginning of November , on Tuesday the second and Wednesday the third .
no , that is not possible for me , unfortunately ,
I am free on Tuesday the ninth , at the earliest .
that is bad for me .
maybe we should consider the end of November then ,
Tuesday the thirtieth and Wednesday the first of December .
that suits me fine .
fine , let us fix that .
I will note that we will meet then .
well , and then we still have to arrange a one day meeting .
and we considered one of the Thursdays for it .
when would you be free on a Thursday in November ?
Thursday the eleventh and the eighteenth would suit me too ,
those are the only two Thursdays in November .
fine , let us take Thursday , the eighteenth of November .
shall we fix that ?
okay .
I will make a note of that as well then .
fine . Mr Piske .
all right then .
thank you ,
and goodbye .
bye .
well , hello , Mr Lange ,
we have to meet three times in all in May and June ,
twice in May and once in June .
I think , I will tell you briefly , when it suits me best .
yes , fine .
Tuesday mornings between eight and twelve and Thursdays between two and four $ P- $ M are generally inconvenient for me .
how about you ?
which days would not suit you at all ?
well Monday from nine $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M and Thursday from one to four $ P- $ M do not suit me at all .
yes , right , then we should better leave out Thursday for now .
Wednesdays and Fridays would be quite convenient
maybe we should see , at what specific time we could meet on a Wednesday or Friday in May .
I will give you the Wednesdays on which I am still free .
it is Wednesday , the fourth of May , and Wednesday , the eleventh of May .
would you also have time on one of these days ?
yes , the fourth and the twenty fifth would suit me fine .
right , so we already have the two dates for May actually .
yes , fine , then we still need a date for June .
and what would you suggest ?
well , we could try Wednesday again .
I would still be free on the fifteenth of June and on the twenty ninth of June .
okay , well only the twenty ninth would be possible for me then .
and I would say , we take the twenty ninth .
yes , fine .
let us keep it like that .
thank you .
fine ,
not at all , thank you ,
bye .
hello , Mr Piske .
I am phoning about our joint visit to the $ I $ A $ A in Frankfurt .
and I wanted to arrange a time , when we could visit the show together with you .
how about you ?
let me tell you right away ,
I will not be able to be there at the weekend .
but I expect to be in Frankfurt from the twelfth of September to the sixteenth of September .
hello , Mr Lange .
the twelfth to the sixteenth .
Tuesday the thirteenth is bad for me ,
I am only free in the morning then .
well I would suggest Wednesday the fourteenth .
does that suit you ?
Wednesday , the fourteenth is fine .
I would say we meet at the information office of the $ I $ A $ A .
and then we could meet there for our joint visit on the fourteenth .
does that suit you ?
yes , that suits me fine .
however , we should meet once more in October .
what days do not suit you at all ?
well Thursday is bad for me .
I will be busy around noon from eleven $ A- $ M to two $ P- $ M then .
and on Friday between three $ P- $ M and seven $ P- $ M .
I would be free on Monday the seventeenth and on the twenty fourth .
how do you feel about that ?
yes , both days are fine .
the seventeenth and the twenty fourth are both possible .
I would say we take the seventeenth ,
would that suit you ?
yes , that would suit me fine .
fine , let us fix that date for a meeting ,
we have to talk about the $ I $ A $ A once more .
and I think it would be reasonable to meet again for a weekend seminar , in order to digest it .
when would you be free for a weekend ?
I think , two days should be necessary .
I would have time on Saturday and Sunday , the first and the second of October .
yes , that suits me fine ,
I have got no other commitments at that time yet .
shall we fix that ?
fine , let us hold that weekend seminar on the first and the second of October .
fine .
well , fine Mr Lange , that is settled too then .
thanks a lot .
and goodbye .
thank you .
goodbye .
hello Mr Lange .
I am calling concerning the tour of the German university towns we planned .
we planned to be away for a whole week ,
but we should meet briefly before that to prepare the tour .
I suggest we try to fix a date for the beginning of July .
however , it does not suit me between ten and twelve $ A- $ M on Mondays and between eight and one $ A- $ M on Wednesdays ,
Thursday afternoon and Friday morning is bad for me .
I would almost say a Tuesday is convenient for both of us ,
what do you think ?
well , do you already have something fixed for the fifth of July ?
yes , that would be fine .
Tuesday , the fifth of July for the preliminary meeting ,
that suits me fine .
let us fix that , okay ?
yes , that suits me fine .
or does Monday afternoon suit you ?
I was just thinking ,
we need a whole week later on and the sooner we hold the preliminary meeting the greater our chances may be later to be away for a whole week .
I think so too ,
the fourth would also suit me .
fine , could you go on the tour right from Tuesday the fifth to , well , Monday the eleventh ?
let me think .
I would have to cancel something then ,
from , what did say please , Tuesday the fifth until ?
well ,
if we held our preliminary meeting on Monday the fourth right in the afternoon we could start out on Tuesday until Monday the eleventh .
we should be away for exactly a week then .
Monday inclusive of course .
I have to reconsider that .
I certainly would not like to cancel my class ,
but it would be possible to do it like this .
could we perhaps try to think of an alternative ?
well , we will always have this problem .
I will have to cancel the class .
alternatively , we could fix a date at the end of July for the tour .
how do you feel about that ?
I will be at a fair in Hannover from the twenty second to the twenty sixth .
and on Friday and Saturday the twenty ninth and thirtieth I have got no time at all either , unfortunately .
yes , that is equally bad with me too .
I am afraid I have not got an entire week for the tour in August either .
so , let us have the preliminary meeting on the fourth then , okay ,
and then start out on the fifth without further ado ,
maybe we should have some time in between .
what do you say ,
should we have some time between the preliminary meeting and the beginning of the tour .
you have to be back on Monday ,
but what do you say to being away from , say , Friday to Friday .
what do you think of that ?
well , we need exactly seven days .
it would be possible for me if we started out on Friday the eighth until Thursday the fourteenth .
okay , Thursday then .
and on Friday you are otherwise engaged , are not you ?
yes , I am afraid so .
okay , I suggest we start out Thursday the seventh until the fourteenth inclusive .
the you will be back on Friday for your commitments .
is that okay ?
yes , right , we will have exactly eight days then .
that is very good .
and we will hold the preliminary meeting on Monday the fourth .
right , we will still have two days in between to prepare for the tour .
fine .
right , Mr Piske , then we still need a follow up meeting where we could get together over a glass of wine .
maybe on a Saturday or Sunday .
how do you feel about the end of July ?
Saturday or Sunday , thirtieth , thirty first ?
fine , then the results will be still fresh in our minds ,
and we could go through them together once again then .
I would also say Sunday the thirty first then .
fine .
hello , Mr Lange .
I am calling , because we have to fix a few dates again .
we are to attend the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S in Stockholm .
I will be in Stockholm from Wednesday the ninth to Wednesday the sixteenth ,
however , I am already booked up between the ninth and eleventh of March ,
so I would only be between the twelfth of sixteenth of July .
how about you ?
it is almost the same with me .
but the fifteenth and the sixteenth would suit me fine .
okay , shall we meet right on Tuesday the fifteenth ?
excellent , Mr Piske , I will put that down right away .
fine .
well , then we still have to go on a five day business trip together .
that would be possible for me at the end of March at the earliest ,
or also between the fifth and the tenth of April or also from the twentieth of April to the twenty eighth of April .
when would you be free for five days ?
what did you say ,
from the twentieth to ?
to the twenty eighth of April .
well , I would be free from the twenty third to the twenty seventh .
that would be five days then .
that would be possible then .
well , I think , we will only have a problem then .
we still have to write a report about the trip .
and there will probably be no free weekend afterwards , as I have got no time on the twenty ninth and thirtieth of April .
I have just discovered that myself .
I would still have got some free days running for the business trip from the twenty seventh to the thirty first of March .
yes , that looks all right .
we can fix that .
fine , the I will put down twenty seventh to the thirty first for the business trip .
well , and then there still is our meeting ,
we should best hold it at the weekend .
and now the question is , as there are the Easter days ,
and I would not like to arrange anything for them , if it can be avoided .
maybe on Saturday , the sixteenth of April ?
unfortunately , I have got no time then .
in April I am only free on the ninth and on the tenth and on the twenty second and the twenty third of April .
well , Mr Piske , let us take the twenty third then ,
that is the only time that is possible for both of us .
well , excuse me ,
the twenty third and twenty fourth are at a weekend of course .
well , let us simply take the weekend , the twenty third and twenty fourth then .
yes , thank you .
okay .
hello , Mr Piske ,
we will have to get together in the next few days ,
and now I would like to know when we could meet for a working meeting .
how about you ,
when is it absolutely impossible for you ?
I am free the day after tomorrow .
no , that is wrong ,
I am not free tomorrow .
I would be free all day today though ,
tomorrow , however , I am not free between four and eight $ P- $ M ,
and after that I would like to be off home .
today is no problem anyway ,
I am free all day .
and I would not be free from eight $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M the day after tomorrow .
yes , fine , shall we get together today then ,
say from ten $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M ?
yes .
fine . ten $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M suits me fine .
and how do we do it tomorrow ,
shall we say we meet at the same time ?
yes , that suits me fine .
fine . and then on the day after tomorrow , we have only got the evening .
maybe right at one $ P- $ M lest it gets too late .
yes , that is fine .
from one to four or five $ P- $ M , okay ?
yes , that is fine , let us do like that .
yes , okay , see you later .
bye .
hello , Mrs M &quot; uller ,
we still have to do some seminar papers together .
could you perhaps come to my place for a working breakfast on Saturday fifteenth ?
Saturday fifteenth suits me fine .
okay , come to my place at nine $ A- $ M then .
that is okay .
we still need to arrange a meeting within the working week .
when does it suit you best ,
shall we arrange that in February ?
yes , we can .
I have nothing planned from the third to the eleventh of February , for example .
let us meet right on February third ,
then I am free the whole .
yes , okay , that is only for breakfast .
yes , that suits me fine .
that is a Thursday , is not it .
yes , I am free on Thursday afternoon .
that is no problem for me .
okay , shall we say half past three $ P- $ M ?
yes , half past three $ P- $ M is fine .
we still need to arrange a second meeting .
for example on Wednesday February ninth ?
that is bad with me .
the time from the seventh to the sixteenth is bad with me .
but then the time from the sixteenth to the twenty third is always fine with me .
I am free again only from the twenty fifth on .
oh , that does not suit me then .
that means that February is booked up somehow .
Tuesday the twenty second would suit me .
Tuesday suits me too ,
that is fine .
let us fix Tuesday the twenty second .
yes , I do already have quite a lot of appointments then but I should manage .
I have already got something in the morning and I will be away before and after that but it will be all right like this .
that means , you will be under stress on Tuesday .
yes , but we will manage ,
it will not take long .
so , let us say at three $ P- $ M already then .
yes , Tuesday from three $ P- $ M .
and how long can you stay then ?
I can stay until the evening .
yes , that will be enough for us .
bye , Mrs Backe .
bye .
well , Mr Arndt , when would a visit to the $ I $ C $ P $ H $ S suit you ?
unfortunately I am only free on Tuesday the fifteenth and Wednesday the sixteenth of March .
yes , that suits me fine too .
shall we take the Tuesday ? .
yes , okay .
then we still have to fix a date for our joint business trip .
I do not know about your schedule , but I would be free right after that until the twenty third .
well , that does not quite suit me .
how about the time from the twenty fifth on ?
the twenty fifth itself , as well as the twenty sixth are bad ,
but I can still fit in five days after that .
yes , that quite suits me too ,
that would be from the twenty seventh to the thirty first of March then .
exactly .
and we should still have to write a report .
maybe right at the weekend after Easter Sunday and Easter Monday ?
yes , although strictly speaking Easter Monday does not pertain to the weekend .
there is some truth in that .
then we should best take the Saturday and maybe the Sunday ?
the second and the third or the ninth and the tenth .
the second and the third .
no , that does not quite suit me ,
that is Holy Saturday .
rather the weekend after perhaps ?
I will be on a business trip to Berlin then .
then I will be busy again ,
then I will not be available again before the twenty third and twenty fourth of April .
okay , let us fix that .
hello , Mr Bl &quot; um ,
my name is Hartmann .
and as you already know , we have to get down to choosing a few dates ,
first of all concerning the seminar on business communication , we have already talked about .
and well , I wanted to ask you , shall we hold in on a monthly or bimonthly basis ?
hello Mr Hartmann .
I would suggest , we proceed bimonthly .
and the seminar on business communication in January , can we let it start on Monday the tenth ?
right , Monday the tenth is very convenient .
okay .
that is four days ,
yes , that fits .
all right .
fine .
the next one right after .
a fourth nightly series on data protection ,
can we let it start right on the first ?
yes , the first is okay ,
though fourth nightly is going to be a bit tight ,
as we have also got the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Osnabr &quot; uck from the eighth to the tenth ,
that is , maybe we should , well , the time from the eleventh to the twentieth is also a bit tight .
but it is quite difficult then .
okay , then I would say , Sunday the sixth , okay .
did I get you right ,
Sunday the sixth ?
yes , okay , Sunday the sixth , for example .
can we fix that then ,
Sunday the sixth , okay ?
do you have any papers , showing how many individual classes there are ?
well , that is not quite obvious from the papers , we have , unfortunately .
we will probably simply take two single days then ,
so we will have two days in the month of March then .
okay , agreed .
Sunday , the sixth and the seventeenth or the sixteenth .
well , the seventeenth would be excellent ,
that would be Thursday , Thursday , the seventeenth .
okay .
okay , well , next , we will probably have to arrange the seminar again for April .
well , there still is Easter first of all ,
and I would say , well , let us start after Easter ,
the time from Wednesday the sixth on would be a possibility for example ,
and then the second date as late in April as possible ,
on the twenty fifth for example , if that suits you .
the twenty fifth would be possible ,
but the fourteenth week is not possible .
yes okay , let us see ,
well , at the beginning of the fifteenth week , on Monday the eleventh ?
agreed .
okay , fine , we have got that also settled then .
then there still is our course on business English of course ,
we have got to arrange eight dates in all ,
so that is going to be quite difficult .
let us see ,
well I think , we should hold only one a day , on eight different days ,
and well ,
maybe we should also start quite early ,
so that we can fit it in May and June if possible ,
well , I would suggest Tuesday the third of May .
that should be okay if it suits you .
the first week of May is not possible for me unfortunately .
and week twenty one is not either .
but otherwise I am free .
Monday the ninth ,
hold on , let me have a look ,
yes okay , that would be possible .
certainly , yes , Ascension day should not be a problem ,
okay , let us do that .
so we have Monday the ninth for the first date .
would Tuesday the tenth be possible ?
we should have one appointment coming immediately after the other ,
but okay , that is not that tragic ,
okay , let us just take Tuesday the tenth then ,
let us do a compact seminar , fine .
so it is Tuesday the tenth .
let us fix the next two dates for the week after Monday and Tuesday the sixteenth and seventeenth ?
yes , that is also fine ,
we can do that ,
right .
we should best do two days four times again , okay , and we will have the eight dates fitted in nicely then .
right , so I will also put down the sixteenth and seventeenth , okay ?
right , and the next dates , well , for some time after Whitsun .
okay , you said , you should be away from the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth that week ,
yes the twenty second week is inconvenient for me ,
the time from the twenty third week on would still be possible .
maybe we should arrange another compact appointment , for Monday the sixth and Tuesday , seventh ?
yes , that would suit me .
Monday the sixth and Tuesday the seventh .
okay , I have put that down .
we still need another two days now ,
the time from the twentieth on would be convenient for me ,
that is the twenty fifth week .
right , let us fix another two days again .
okay excellent .
we have got that settled then after all .
that is fine .
well ,
next we have the planning for the computer network , of course , that we still have to discuss today , too , unfortunately ,
luckily we need only six dates ,
we might not need a whole day for that , that remains to be seen .
well , I think we should allow for six entire days for the moment ,
we can always decide , whether we should do it in the mornings or in the afternoons later on .
well I would suggest , we start at some time on Tuesday the fifth of July ,
that is the twenty seventh week .
unfortunately that is not possible for me , as I have got a holiday in the twenty seventh and the twenty eighth week .
but after that I am flexible .
yes fine , however the thirtieth week is impossible for me ,
but we could meet in the twenty ninth week for example ,
maybe we could also fix two dates for then ,
Monday and Tuesday again somehow would be pretty convenient , if that is possible .
so that is Monday the eighteenth and Tuesday the nineteenth of July .
fine .
yes okay , I have put that down .
after that , as I said , I will be away in the thirtieth week ,
the beginning of the thirty first week again if that is possible ,
or let us say Wednesday and Thursday in the thirty first week perhaps ,
that would be Wednesday the third and Thursday the fourth of August .
okay .
yes fine , then we still need another two .
well the time towards the end of August is very inconvenient for me ,
well I am booked up from the fifteenth to the thirtieth actually ,
there are still a few blanks though , but they are mostly at the weekend ,
I would suggest Thursday the eleventh and Friday the twelfth of August .
we should have all six dates fixed then .
okay .
yes fine , that was quick .
then we still have to think of the communication course .
let us see , how much time we will have to allow for that .
I would suggest , we should best do it a week long as a compact seminar again ,
otherwise we will have to let the people go time and again and will waste a lot of time with short patches .
so a week would really be the best , and I would suggest , the beginning of the thirty seventh week or so ,
so that would be Monday the twelfth of September and then we will have to see .
so maybe we can take the whole week already .
that would be the time from Monday the twelfth to Friday the sixteenth then ,
maybe also Saturday morning with it , Saturday the seventeenth .
unfortunately I have got a congress in Amsterdam in the thirty seventh week ,
so we could not do it a whole week long .
however I am available for a whole week in the thirty sixth , the thirty eighth ,
the thirty ninth and the forty second week .
well , the thirty sixth is not possible , as it is the $ I $ A $ A in Hannover then ,
but , you said the thirty eighth was possible for you ,
we could perhaps fix the thirty eighth then ,
that would be from Monday , the nineteenth to Friday the or Saturday the twenty fourth .
okay , let us take the twenty eighth week .
yes fine , so that date is also fixed then .
right , let us come to the staff meeting for the yearly planning nineteen ninety five ,
we need four dates spread over November and December .
can we start right on Tuesday the eighth ?
let me have a quick look
well , Tuesday the eighth would just be possible ,
however only this week ,
I am completely booked up the week after , the twenty sixth , the one with the day of prayer and repentance , unfortunately .
are they to be one day dates , I think they are , are not they .
if we do it like this , then I would say , we start on Tuesday the eighth .
then I would suggest , we fix another two for the end of November in the forty seventh week ,
does that suit you ?
well , the forty seventh would be okay ,
and we should also consider ,
fixing all four dates for that time , as experience shows , it is always fairly tight in December at the end of the year .
maybe we can fit all dates into November .
well the forty seventh week would be possible , would not it ?
maybe we can fix at least two dates in a row ,
well I would suggest , say , Monday the twenty first and Tuesday the twenty second .
Monday the twenty first and Tuesday the twenty second .
yes exactly .
fine , then we have still got another one .
I would quite like it , if we held it as late in December as possible ,
maybe on the twenty second ?
well , okay ,
of course , some of our employees and I myself will probably be away in Stuttgart from the nineteenth to the twenty third ,
that is , it is going to be too tight then ,
so if we still fix a date for December , then it would quite suit me ,
if we fixed it for the time before the sixteenth ,
the sixteenth is a Friday
and the week before , that is the fiftieth week , would also be possible .
yes okay , will you suggest a day ?
well I would say , we simply take Wednesday , the fourteenth , okay ,
if you like .
okay .
yes fine , we have also got that fixed then .
coming up next is our project meeting ,
unfortunately we have to plan three hours for it ,
we have to see , which week we should take .
it is probably the next one already ,
it would be best , if we did it some time on Mondays
well I will simply give you the free days ,
but on Monday afternoon and Wednesday morning I have got a visit to the Ministry in both cases ,
and I have got no time then in any case , you see .
would it suit you ,
if we fixed a date for Monday morning and for Wednesday afternoon in any case then ?
you have got time on Monday afternoon and on Wednesday morning ?
no , exactly the other way round ,
those were the times , when I have no time .
okay , then we will have to switch to other days .
Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning ?
Thursday morning will be a bit tight ,
but we can already plan Tuesday afternoon ,
I would say , not too late ,
that is from about two to five $ P- $ M on Tuesday afternoon , if you like .
fine .
Tuesday , from two to five $ P- $ M .
well , can we arrange the other three hours for Friday afternoon ?
yes , Friday afternoon would still be possible ,
Friday morning would not suit you ?
no , there is a board meeting on Friday morning .
can we meet on Friday afternoon from two to five $ P- $ M again ?
hello ,
my name is Hansj &quot; org Felmy .
well , hello ,
I am Peter Gottschalk .
it is about the dates , we have to conduct together .
first of all there is a four day seminar on business communication in January or February .
do you have any preferences ?
as we want to hold it in Cologne , it would suit me , if we held it after the seventh week .
that would also be possible for me ,
that is , from Monday , the twenty first of February on .
that is okay by me .
so it is Monday , the twenty first to Thursday , the twenty first .
I would still have time in one of the halves of March or April .
in fact for the series of talks on the data protection plan ,
the duration would be fourteen days .
right .
well ,
in March , the time from , say , the eleventh to the twelfth week would fit in my schedule quite well .
unfortunately I have got no time in the twelfth week , as I will have to go to the CeBIT in Hannover then .
and , yes , hang on ,
I have just got to think about this ,
that is really inconvenient for me .
how do you feel about the time after Easter ?
the week after Easter is not possible for me .
all that remains
well , fourteen days are not possible for me at all .
I have made a mistake
it takes one day , and will be held fourtnightly .
I see ,
so it is merely a day ,
Friday is not quite possible for me ,
I would rather take the beginning of the week .
so let us take , for example , Tuesday , the first , Tuesday , the fifteenth , Tuesday , the
oh , no , I have got no time then .
well , Tuesday would suit me too .
we will simply have to cancel it twice then ,
in the week , when I will be at the CeBIT , and in the week before Easter ,
so that we keep to these two days and continue after Easter .
and if we try to fix it for another day ,
say , for the
well , no , must be cancelled
it is the same with me ,
that is , it has to be cancelled even more often .
nevertheless I am in favour of keeping the two Tuesdays ,
maybe we can fix another day then .
okay .
fine .
so , there are eight dates for a course in business English to be fixed for May and June .
well ,
except for the &quot; Ogai annual conference at the $ T $ U of Vienna , which lasts from the thirteenth to the sixteenth of June , I have got quite a lot of time in June .
that is , June would quite suit me ,
if we we could fix the majority of the dates for then .
I will also be present at that conference ,
and apart from that I have only got dates for the time from the last week of May to the third of June .
the week before is inconvenient for me ,
that is , the week after Whitsun , and the first week of May .
well , everything else would be at our disposal ,
then I would say ,
we fix the first date for Monday , the ninth of May ,
the second for Friday ,
the thirteenth ,
the third for Tuesday ,
the seventeenth ,
the fourth for Friday ,
the twentieth
and then take a break of two weeks
and continue in June then .
yes , that suits me .
well ,
as the the other four dates I would suggest Tuesday , the the seventh ,
Friday ,
the tenth , and then Tuesday , the twenty first and Friday , the twenty fourth of June , for example .
I think , we should fix the last four dates for the time before the annual conference in Vienna ,
that is , Monday , the sixth , Wednesday , the eighth , Thursday , the ninth and Friday , the tenth .
all right ,
that is okay by me .
well , the computer network has to be planned in July and August ,
that would be six dates .
I am telling you right away ,
that I will be on holiday until the beginning of the twenty ninth week ,
that is , Monday , the eighth of July ,
and everything would have to take place after that .
when is your holiday ?
otherwise I would say , we fix one date for each of the remaining six weeks .
no , that is not possible for me unfortunately .
and from the thirty third week on I will go away on holiday .
that is , the twenty ninth , the thirty first and the thirty second , three weeks are left .
that is , two dates a week .
I have also got a staff meeting , on the twenty second of July though ,
and we could fix all the other dates for the remaining time .
fine , then I would say , let us get started ,
shall we agree on the Monday and Thursday of each of the three weeks ?
Monday and Thursday suit me .
okay , it is Monday , the eighth ,
sorry , Monday ,
the eighteenth of July ,
Thursday ,
the twenty first of July ,
Monday ,
the first of August ,
Thursday ,
the fourth of August ,
Monday ,
the eighth of August , and Thursday ,
the eleventh of August .
all these dates suit me fine .
that is fine .
I would still have something for September or October ,
in fact a communication course for executives ,
and we should also arrange a few dates for that .
well ,
in the middle of September ,
that is ,
from Monday ,
the twelfth to Wednesday ,
the fourteenth of September ,
I will be at a congress in Amsterdam ,
I have got no time in the week from the third to the eighth of October ,
and on Monday , the tenth I will be at the $ Z $ D $ F in Mainz ,
apart from that I am still free in those two months .
maybe we should agree on the duration first .
well , I think , it should be possible to hold this seminar within five days .
well , yes , a week should be possible .
I would suggest , well , that we consider the twenty eighth week for it .
that is , Monday , the nineteenth of September till Friday , the twenty third .
exactly .
okay , we should put these dates down then .
all right .
at the end of the year the year nineteen ninety five must be planned .
that is , we have to hold a staff meeting , to fix the relevant topics for the next year .
exclusive of the time around Christmas of course ,
besides I have got no time at the beginning of November ,
that is I will only be back from the seventh of November on .
I will be away in the forty sixth week from the fourteenth of November to the eighteenth of November .
well , how about a staff meeting on the Fridays before each Sunday in Advent .
I would rather hold them on Mondays ,
in fact once a week from the forty seventh week on perhaps .
so , the twenty first , the twenty eighth , well , the fifth of December and the twelfth of December .
that is correct .
fine .
I would still have a project meeting for the next week , that we should have to fix ,
in fact it is two times for three hours .
I will not be free on Monday morning ,
it is my weekly planning meeting then ,
then on Tuesday morning I have got a business meeting ,
ditto on Thursday from two to four $ P- $ M .
Friday morning is a board meeting
and on Wednesday afternoon I will be playing golf .
I have got an interview at the $ W $ D $ R for Monday afternoon ,
I would be free on Tuesday ,
I will have to go away on Wednesday morning unfortunately
and I have got a visit to the ministry for Thursday .
well , then I would suggest , we take Tuesday afternoon and Friday afternoon .
shall we say , from two to five $ P- $ M ?
that suits me fine .
okay .
in the next two days we still have to hold three working meetings for preparation in any case .
in the next two days I have got no time tomorrow from four to six $ P- $ M ,
and the day after tomorrow is also fairly bad actually ,
well ,
if at all then I have got time in the late afternoon tomorrow or today ,
no ,
in the late afternoon the day after tomorrow and tomorrow morning .
as for me , I have got no time around lunchtime either actually ,
well , Monday morning would quite suit me ,
and otherwise maybe an hour or so until six $ P- $ M then .
an hour or so , well , okay .
well , then I thank you for the cooperation with the dates ,
well , I think , we have come to an agreement .
yes , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
Schneider speaking ,
is that Mrs M &quot; uller speaking ?
yes , good morning , Mrs Schneider ,
this is Mrs M &quot; uller speaking ,
I am calling concerning the seminar on business communication which is to last four days and is to be held in January or February still ,
and I wanted to discuss the dates , on which we could probably hold it with you .
actually , January would be quite convenient for me .
and I do not have that many appointments in February either .
on January the twenty sixth and twenty seventh I will be at a conference in Brussels ,
and I have got no time on the days before the carnival , from the seventh to the eleventh , and on the carnival days either .
well , that coincides to a large degree with my dates .
I would have time on January the twenty sixth and twenty seventh ,
but I have got no time from the seventeenth to the nineteenth in turn because of a fair in Berlin ,
and I have got no time from the third to the seventh of January ,
but apart from that everything coincides with what you said .
do you have any definite suggestions ?
when would it suit you best ?
well , February the first or the time after the carnival , from the twenty first on , seems convenient to me ,
or we could perhaps fix it for the middle of January .
that would be before my conference in Brussels .
thus I would have enough time between the two dates on which I am away to prepare myself sufficiently .
what do you think of the time from the first of February till the fourth ?
that would be exactly the time when I have already got three appointments , which would leave me little time in between ,
the middle of January would seemed best to me actually
could you give me the precise days .
well , I would say from the seventh of January to the twenty second .
well the time between the seventeenth and the nineteenth is not possible for me because of that fair in Berlin ,
the time around the eleventh , that is the eleventh ,
the twelfth , the thirteenth and the fourteenth , would be more convenient for me then
or if you do not mind deferring it even further we could also do it at the end of February .
these would be the most convenient days for me .
okay , we will surely reach an agreement .
these days are convenient for me as well ,
as you said , either from January the eleventh on or at the end of February .
as I would prefer it directly January , on the eleventh .
fine .
okay , let us fix January the eleventh , the twelfth , the thirteenth and he fourteenth .
would that suit you ?
yes , that would suit me fine .
okay .
then we have to fix the dates for this series of talks on data protection .
in fact I think it would be convenient to hold the talks fourtnightly .
when would it suit you ?
yes fourtnightly .
as for me , I will be at a conference in Osnabr &quot; uck from the eighth to the eleventh of March .
and I have got no time from the fifth to the eighth of April ,
and I will also be away from the twentieth to the twenty second of April .
well the eighth to the eleventh of March coincide with my schedule ,
I will be in Osnabr &quot; uck then too ,
we will surely run into each other then .
after that I have also got another appointment in March ,
but I am free any time in April apart from the Easter holidays ,
as you have got more appointments then , which days would you suggest ?
as we want to do it fourtnightly , I would suggest ,
we begin on Monday the fourteenth of March for the first time ,
but no , that is not possible after all , because I have got no time on March twenty eighth .
we should consider doing it every three weeks .
well , I think that will tear it a bit too far apart ,
I have just discovered that I will also be away from the twenty eighth to the thirty third ,
so that matches with your dates as well
I would say we leave it at the fourtnightly cycle
we could try to find an alternative day , if it should not be possible at all ,
but I think the fourtnightly cycle should be kept as otherwise there would be so much time between the talks that I do not see any sense in the whole thing anymore ,
and what is more , the series would be so extended that it would take ages .
well , let me have a look ,
if we fixed the first date for the seventh of March , then the second one would be the twenty first ,
I would have time then ,
I will be away the following week but it will not take place then anyway ,
after that is Easter Monday and it will not take place then either as it is a public holiday ,
after that we could fix a date for the eleventh and then another one for Monday the twenty fifth .
well ,
Monday would be bad for me in so far as I will be at the CeBIT in Hannover and therefore would not attend it .
what do you think of fixing Thursday ,
as thus no day would be lost due to public holidays such as Easter Monday .
we would start on a Thursday of your choice , I can not remember all your dates actually , and we would structure the whole thing accordingly .
well , our joint date for the conference in Osnabr &quot; uck is on a Thursday
I would have no time on the thirty first , the seventh and the twenty first of April then ,
it is obvious that we have to have more time between the dates ,
or we confine ourselves to a Wednesday starting on the second ,
the next date then would be the sixteenth
the next inconvenient day would be the thirtieth ,
we should see that we allow more time between the dates .
we could arrange it so that we fix one day now and update our schedule later on .
that is , we arrange the next date each evening
and we meet two weeks later on a day when everybody is free .
when do you think shall we start ,
right at the beginning of March or rather in the middle of March ?
I would say at the beginning of March ,
we would have much more time for the other appointments then ,
it would be much easier to have , say , three weeks between the appointments from time to time
that would not be a problem .
yes , I would say we start right on the first of March ,
that would be the Tuesday ,
and we could arrange the next appointments then .
yes , fine I think so too .
so , it is Thursday the first of March .
yes , okay , I will put that down .
right , and there is also a course in business English in May and June consisting of eight sessions .
as for me , I do not have time from the thirtieth of May to the third of June inclusive
and I will be at a conference in Vienna from the thirteenth to the sixteenth in June .
the Whit holidays as well as Ascension day are not possible either ,
when does it suit you ?
well , we have got a another joint date then , namely the conference in Vienna ,
I have got no time then either .
it is also not possible the time after the Whit holidays , that is from the twenty fourth to the twenty seventh ,
and I have got an appointment from the second to the sixth of May .
yes , that is perfect , actually .
so ,
we both would be free until Whitsun , and we should be free again from the sixteenth on , so that we can arrange eight appointments then .
let me check , that are one ,
two , three ,
four , five , five and a half to six weeks we can use for planning .
I would say we arrange two appointments a week ,
for example on Monday and Thursday ,
then we should have enough time to prepare for the other course and to revise .
right , that would not be a problem either .
then I would suggest we start right on Monday the second of May ,
and fix the next session for Thursday ,
and well , it is not possible in the week after because of Ascension day ,
we could take Monday and Friday , for example ,
and the week after Monday and Thursday again
and then we still need only two appointments , basically ,
that we could fix for the middle of June or the end of June ,
that is completely up to you .
well , we can only start on the ninth of March because I will away at the beginning of March ,
we could take Monday and Friday then , maybe after Ascension day ,
otherwise I agree with your schedule .
fine ,
let us start on Monday then ninth and then take Friday the thirteenth and the week after , Monday and Thursday ,
I would say we take June the sixth and the ninth for the time after the ninth ,
and then we need only two dates ,
say , the twentieth and twenty third ,
how do you feel about that ?
yes , that is a very good solution .
that suits me fine .
right , the we still need the remaining six dates for computer networks ,
so there are still six dates to be arranged for July and August ,
although I have already got a tight schedule for August ,
I will not be here from the fifteenth to the nineteenth as well as from the twenty second to the twenty sixth and from the twenty ninth to the thirty first
I will have a holiday then ,
besides I will be away from the twenty fifth to the twenty ninth of July ,
I have got a stuff council meeting on July the twenty second and an interview with the $ W $ D $ R on the first of July ,
so , these are the days on which I am already booked up
basically I would be free from July the fourth to July the twenty first and from the first to the fourteenth of August .
when would it suit you ?
the holidays will be a bit of a problem for us as you are not free the whole August ,
that is from the fifteenth of August on ,
so we have only got the time between Monday the eighteenth and Wednesday the twentieth of July and the days between the first and the twelfth of August .
well , I see , that is going to be a fairly tight schedule ,
I would say we arrange the first four dates for Monday the fourth and the days after
that would suit you I think ?
July ?
yes .
no , I have a holiday from the fourth of July on .
from the fourth of July on ?
I thought August .
I must have misunderstood you then .
then you are free in August ,
would the beginning suit you then ?
yes the beginning of August ,
you have a holiday from the fifteenth on ,
that would be the first two weeks of August and the few days between the fifteenth and the twenty first of July .
well , I have a holiday for the whole rest of August ,
we should agree on the first two weeks of August then ,
I would say we put the dates relatively close together on every evening in a week ,
that is from the first to the fifteenth ,
and then also Monday the eighth ,
then we will have got over with it .
or we
there are six dates ,
we do it every two days ,
that would fit exactly ,
Monday , Wednesday and Friday ,
that is three times a week .
yes , that would be okay too ,
I agree with it .
that would be the first , the third , the fifth , the eighth , the tenth and the twelfth of August .
yes , exactly ,
and afterwards you can relax and go on holiday .
yes , very good ,
that suits me fine .
fine , and then there still is a conversation course for executives we have to fix the dates for ,
for September or October in fact ,
as for me , I will be at the $ I $ A $ A in Hannover from the seventh to the eighth of September ,
the third of October is not possible because of the day of German unity
after that I have got a press conference on the eighteenth of October ,
and otherwise I am free for the most part actually
how about you ?
well , I think we will come to an agreement easily then ,
I have also got only one appointment in September from the twelfth to the fourteenth ,
I will be at a congress in Amsterdam then ,
then , as you said , is the day of German unity
and after that I am also booked until the seventh ,
and on tenth of October I have got a visit to $ Z $ D $ F in Mainz .
fine , then I would say , maybe we meet on the first of September for the first time ,
decide how many sessions we will need for that conversation course at all ,
and fix the rest of the dates together with the others .
yes , that would suit me fine ,
if you do not mind ,
as you will be on holiday until thirty first of August we could also meet on the fifth of September for the first time .
well , I would not mind that ,
I will be very rested then ,
it would give me a better start if I started with it ,
so , if you do not mind , we take the first .
yes , I would also say , we start right on September the first .
as for me ,
well , All-Saints-Day on the first of November is impossible in any case ,
after that I will be away from the fourteenth to the eighteenth of November ,
as well as in the week from the nineteenth to the twenty third of December ,
and I will also be away in the week after Christmas , that is between Christmas and New-Years-Eve ,
otherwise it would be no problem for me actually .
well , I have also got only one appointment in November ,
it is right after All-Saints-Day until the fourth of November ,
and otherwise it is rather convenient for me .
fine , then suggest a time when it suits you best .
well , four days were planned ,
I would say we start right at the beginning of November as there are all the Christmas days in December .
the seventh of November would suit me then .
no problem ,
I am free at that time too
that would also suit me fine .
okay .
let us fix the seventh .
then you will be away ,
we can take another Monday two weeks later then
that would be the twenty first .
yes , that is no problem either .
then we could either take the week right after or have a break of one week in between and do not meet until Monday the fifteenth .
though I think a weekly basis would not be that bad actually ,
we should get it over with on the twenty eighth and on the fifth , as there is Christmas time afterwards
and I guess ,
you have got enough stress at home ,
so that you would not want to trouble yourself with great business matters ,
well ,
if you do not mind ,
I would say , Monday ,
twenty eighth of November and Monday the fifth .
yes , we would have exactly four appointments then
and we should have the first one on November the seventh ,
and then a break of one week until the twenty first
yes , fine , that suits me fine as well .
right , we have got that fixed then .
so we still have to fix a date for the project meeting we have to hold twice for three hours next week ,
as for me , I have got an appointment with a reporter from the $ W $ D $ R on Monday from two to six o &apos;clock $ P- $ M
I have got no time on Wednesday from nine to twelve and at the same time on Thursday , as I will be at the ministry then .
how about you ?
well , I have got a tight schedule too
especially on Mondays as there is the weekly planning from nine to twelve ,
you would not have time from two to six $ P- $ M
Monday is impossible then
and I have also got an appointment from nine to twelve on Tuesday , a business meeting in fact ,
and there is a board meeting on Friday from ten to twelve
and there is another appointment from two to three $ P- $ M on Thursday
I would say we could already agree on Tuesday evening from two to five $ P- $ M .
yes , that would suit me fine ,
and I would say , we do the same on Wednesday ,
as there will be the fewest overlaps then .
I have only got something fixed in the morning then and I am free the whole afternoon ,
I guess , Thursday is also fairly tight for you as you will be away until three $ P- $ M already
well , I would say Tuesday and Wednesday at the same time , then .
I have just seen that I have got another appointment at six $ P- $ M on Wednesday ,
I will have to cancel my lunch break if necessary or bring it forward ,
or we could agree on Friday afternoon .
yes , Friday is also okay for me ,
no problem .
what time would you suggest ?
I would say , right after the lunch break , from two to five $ P- $ M again .
okay . fine .
thank you for calling .
I think we still have to fix the time for three working meetings within the next two days .
ah , yes , right ,
I have just found the papers .
fine today , however , is a problem for me .
I will be away from one to three $ P- $ M
tomorrow from eleven $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M and from three to five and the day after tomorrow from nine to twelve and two to four $ P- $ M are not possible either .
and how about you ?
well , I think there are quite a few appointments in our way
well , today I have still got an appointment from four to six $ P- $ M
tomorrow I am booked from ten to one $ P- $ M and then again from two to four $ P- $ M and from nine to eleven $ A- $ M the day after tomorrow ,
I do not have your dates in my head anymore , but we could fix a meeting for perhaps the day after tomorrow from twelve o &apos;clock on .
well if will not take too long ,
I will be away from two to for $ P- $ M actually ,
so , if we confined ourselves to one hour it would suit me ,
otherwise I would only see this morning , that is , within the next few hours .
it would not be a problem before one $ P- $ M ,
tomorrow after five $ P- $ M and on Friday either from twelve to two $ P- $ M or from four to six $ P- $ M
how about you ?
yes , fine , those times would suit me .
so it would be today then
and tomorrow I am free from four $ P- $ M on ,
we could meet from four to six $ P- $ M then
and , as I said , I am free the whole Friday afternoon .
I would say that as I am already booked from three to five $ P- $ M tomorrow and we should only have one hour
I would say , that as for today I agree with you ,
and I would say the day after tomorrow from four $ P- $ M on as I have got only one appointment from two to four $ P- $ M then .
how do you feel about that ?
okay , we should only have two working meetings then ,
but we could drag out the appointment on the day after tomorrow a bit .
I would agree to that .
once more today ?
the day after tomorrow .
the day after tomorrow would suit me fine too .
we could do that as well ,
then we should confine ourselves to today and the day after tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow we should get together for a few more hours .
fine , agreed .
that is it then , is not it ?
thank you very much for your call .
and I thank you for letting it all go so smoothly and coming to an agreement with me at last .
take care .
see you later ,
bye .
yes , goodbye , Mrs Schneider .
hello
Weber speaking ,
I wanted to get in touch with you once more ,
firstly , we wanted to attend that &quot; Ogai conference in the middle of June ,
and secondly , we wanted to talk once more about the business English course that we booked together
yes ,
it is good , you called ,
I wanted to do that too , you know
only I have got commitments upon commitments
well , when shall we hold the business English course ?
what do you think of May ?
well , we had been thinking of May or June in principle already ,
that is fine , except that there are the Whit holidays ,
that is , there are a couple of public holidays in the Whit week ,
and the first week of May is not possible either if I am not mistaken
many employees like to take a holiday then ,
but I would say we should try to fix two or three dates for May ,
and the rest for June .
yes , certainly , there is no other way ,
we have got eight in all ,
and roughly nine to ten weeks in May and June at the most ,
I would only say that we should be careful , that we do not fix anything for a Friday as there are public holidays on a Tuesday twice and the people will make use of the long weekend ,
and the whole thing would be pointless then
on the other hand I would not like the middle of the week either ,
as the whole thing would be torn apart a bit then
so , maybe rather at the beginning of the week all the time ,
and perhaps a fixed day probably would not be bad either .
well , as the people are normally ill on Mondays , I suggest Tuesday .
okay .
although , the people normally being ill on Mondays is somewhat exaggerated .
well .
maybe one can soon take Friday as well for if the federal government goes on with it all these wonderful public holidays will be abolished .
okay .
let us get down to business
I would say ,
well , as I said before the first week of May is not possible ,
the first possible day would be Tuesday the tenth and the following Tuesday the seventeenth and the following Tuesday the twenty fourth .
well , why not the first week of May ?
I think , that week is particularly convenient , as the employees can take their holiday at the Whit weekend .
sorry , that is not possible for us
we are booked up from the second to the sixth of May .
well , that is of course bad .
well , let us fix the first appointment for Tuesday the tenth and the second appointment for Tuesday the seventeenth ,
but I would move the Tuesday after Whit Monday further towards the middle of the week ,
say , to Wednesday perhaps .
okay , fine , I would have overlooked that ,
anyway , I would prefer to drop the week from Whit Tuesday to Friday altogether because experience shows that quite a few people tend to be on holiday then ,
we said three appointments in May
thirty first of May for the third appointment , okay ?
unfortunately , that will be a problem for us
we will have an event at our company that week and therefore can not send any employees ,
so , we either fix something for the week after Whitsun or we fix two appointments for one week in June .
Monday thirtieth of May is not possible either ?
no , we are booked up for the whole week .
right , and I would like to keep Whit week free for me .
well , I would say we try Wednesday , first of June .
if I got you right , it is also booked , is not it ?
as I said before , the whole week inclusive of the third ,
but what do you think of having two appointments a week in June ,
in fact I would say we should have a day in between ,
then we could fix Tuesday and Thursday and should thus be able to fit in the rest of our appointments .
I do not think that much of it , because it will certainly raise the travelling expenses considerably .
yes , sure ,
but on the other hand we have the hotel expenses for the employees who come from farther away ,
I would prefer the travelling expenses to the hotel expenses .
well , yes , you are nearer to it after all ,
but we can agree on that ,
I do not want to exaggerate .
okay , I would say we try it the other way round ,
let us fix Thursday the thirtieth and Tuesday the twenty eighth .
okay .
fine let us take a look at the twenty third and the twenty first in the week before ,
does it suit you ?
well , listen ,
there is a conference from the thirteenth to the sixteenth
and we should not have too many appointments at a time ,
maybe we should have only one appointment in the week from the twentieth to the twenty fourth .
on Tuesday in fact , okay ?
yes , okay .
maybe we should arrange an appointment for the week before the conference
Tuesday the seventh ?
no , the conference is okay too ,
only we are going there ,
the employees can attend the course ,
that is no problem .
on the fourteenth and seventh then
if you like .
okay , the fourteenth and the seventh ,
so , we should count now .
one is missing .
well , I would suggest we take the twenty third .
do you mean the twenty third of July ?
the Thursday .
okay , agreed ,
then I will make that into a seven
no , wait , I have already counted backwards ,
it is a three then ,
third session on June seventh ,
the fourth session on June fourteenth ,
the fifth session on Thursday the twenty third and the last one on June fourteenth .
yes , okay , that suits me fine .
how about the conference ,
have you got a hotel yet ?
no , not yet .
I would say maybe if you ask your secretary to do it ,
she could perhaps book one for me too ?
yes , we could do that .
what price range did you have in mind ?
I see yet another problem here
I have to come back to it again
it has not been settled yet ,
I have found a contradiction here
is the last session on Tuesday the twenty eighth or on Thursday the thirtieth ,
it got a bit mixed up here ,
what do you have ?
well I have got the last two sessions scheduled for Tuesday the twenty eighth and Thursday thirtieth .
okay both .
I misunderstood that then .
okay , then we have to count again ,
no , I have got eight dates put down too ,
everything should be all right then .
right , I will book the hotel then ,
I will get in touch with you again in the next few days ,
and , well , then I would say , see you then , okay ?
yes , see you .
good luck ,
bye .
bye .
P &quot; atzhold speaking .
hello , Mrs P &quot; atzhold ,
this is Schneidereit speaking .
we wanted to get together about the course in business English .
would you like to come over to me
or shall we do it on the phone now ?
we could well discuss it now
to tell the truth , I do not have that much time now .
we have got eight dates to fix .
and my first question is ,
whether we should do it en bloc on a fixed day of a week or in several separate classes ,
or what did you have in mind ?
well , I was thinking of two classes a week perhaps ,
lest there will be too much at once .
it is an all day course ,
otherwise there is probably be too much material ,
and after all , the participants should revise .
shall we fix it for two days running , as a small block so to speak ,
or simply separate ,
or shall we fix it ,
or what do you want ?
maybe we should see how our other dates coincide .
have you already got any dates at which you are booked up .
well , the principal date is one , we have together ,
we will be at a conference in Vienna from the thirteenth to the sixteenth then .
well , yes , that is right ,
but I was thinking of one at which you are going on holiday or something .
I see ,
well , there is only one period when I will be away ,
that is from the thirtieth to third in the twenty second week ,
I will be away on holiday the whole week then .
well , I will have a holiday in the week before ,
that is from Whitsun , the twenty third to the twenty seventh .
and at the beginning of May I will be at a conference .
that is from the the second to the sixth of May .
that is , the eighteenth , the twenty first and the twenty second week are not possible ,
and we can also forget about the twenty fourth week with the conference ,
I think that due to the conference we will not be that receptive any more then .
well , okay .
let us see what dates we can fix between the ninth and the twentieth and maybe still in the week before the conference .
well , we basically still have four weeks no , five well , four and a half five weeks even free .
okay , then we could fix two dates for each week ,
and that is it then .
yes , okay .
right in the first week there is a public holiday , Ascension day ,
so that leaves us with only four days again ,
well , Monday is usually a rather packed day ,
as everybody wants to know something from you at the beginning of the week ,
I would say Tuesday or Wednesday
or that is , Tuesday and Wednesday , as we have to postpone two .
yes , I would say so too ,
let us fix Tuesday and Wednesday for the first week .
okay , just a moment , I am just putting that down .
shall we simply keep to these two days of the week ,
I think , that would be rather convenient .
yes , we can leave it at this for the time being ,
but we should also arrange an alternative date in case something crops up on one of the two days ,
and we also have the twenty sixth week as an alternative week to which we can postpone cancelled dates .
yes , I think that is a good idea ,
we can do that .
let us fix the next date for the seventeenth and eighteenth of May for now .
yes , and then I would still have the seventh and eighth of June .
yes , that would be okay .
and then I still have the twenty first and twenty second of June ,
that is the week after the conference .
well , I have just discovered that I have an important date on the twenty first ,
I would prefer to fix it for the twenty second and twenty third .
well , that is no problem for me .
let us simply postpone it for a day .
that is fine ,
we have settled that then .
let us keep the twenty sixth week open then ,
say , we do not arrange any other dates for that week ,
so that we have some alternative time .
yes , I like that too .
besides we will meet at the conference in Vienna .
yes , at the conference at the latest .
no doubt we will meet on the premises from time to time
fine , have a nice day then ,
see you .
goodbye , Mrs P &quot; atzhold .
yes , goodbye , Mr Schneidereit .
hello , I would like to speak to Mr Meyer .
yes , this is Mr Meyer speaking .
who is that speaking ?
that is fine ,
I am calling concerning the appointment for our colleagues ,
business English , do you remember ?
yes , right ,
make a suggestion ,
when does it suit you ?
well , we said May ,
how do you feel about the first week ,
does it suit you ?
during the first week ,
I am just checking that ,
I have nothing planned then .
that is bad , as I have planned a lot then ,
but I would have time on Saturday , May seventh .
would that suit you ?
I am still free on Saturday , May seventh .
we could take it .
so the first date is Saturday , May seventh .
fine .
okay , Thursday the following week is a public holiday ,
but otherwise I have not planned anything then ,
how about you ?
neither have I ,
but we should see that we do it in the middle as two days running are not convenient .
yes , how about Wednesday , May eleventh ?
excellent suggestion , I am for it .
okay , then that is the second appointment ,
let me see .
how about Friday May thirteenth ?
that would suit me too .
any objections to Friday the thirteenth ?
no , not me .
okay , that is the third appointment .
then we could meet in the twentieth week on Thursday , the nineteenth ?
I am still free then
yes , we could take it too ,
so , that is the fourth appointment then .
yes .
okay .
then there is week after Whitsun .
basically , I am free all the time then .
I am busy the whole week long .
how about the twenty second week ?
that one is bad with me ,
I have got appointments all the time then .
no , we should consider the twenty third week
Monday , June sixth .
yes , that would suit me too .
how about the Tuesday and the Thursday then ?
good idea .
yes , okay , Tuesday June seventh and Thursday June ninth .
right , after that there is our annual congress in Vienna .
and after that , how do you feel about the time from the twenty fifth week on ?
just a moment , basically I am free all the time from the twenty fifth week on .
we could take the same day as before
we could take Tuesday and Thursday again ,
that was good .
just a moment , I am just counting
so far we have got one , two , three , four , five , six appointments
these would be the seventh and the eighth ,
and that would be it then .
good idea .
so , Tuesday June twenty first and Thursday June twenty third .
yes .
okay .
let us also fix the exact times .
well , I think , we should not start that early on Saturday ,
I would prefer the afternoon then .
yes , but it should be possible to meet from one $ P- $ M on .
okay .
Saturday , at one $ P- $ M .
what about Wednesday before Ascension day ?
four $ P- $ M ?
a quarter past four $ P- $ M ?
okay , agreed , four $ P- $ M .
okay , well , a quarter past four $ P- $ M ,
but four $ P- $ M is okay .
in case one is late ,
okay .
I think we should start early on Friday
how about nine o &apos;clock ?
oh , very good .
shall we also say nine o &apos;clock on Thursday , May nineteenth ,
or would you prefer ten o &apos;clock ?
no , rather ten o &apos;clock ,
I think nine o &apos;clock on Thursday does not suit me after all ,
yes , ten o &apos;clock is better
okay .
ten o &apos;clock .
how about June seventh and ninth at ten o &apos;clock too ?
yes , that is okay .
fine .
shall we also say ten o &apos;clock for the twenty first and twenty third in the last week of June ?
eleven o &apos;clock may be better on the twenty first .
but ten o &apos;clock on Thursday is all right .
yes , that is fine .
yes , excellent .
that fits well in my schedule .
so it does in mine .
fine .
goodbye , Mr Kl &quot; auser .
see you , Mr Meyer ,
bye .
hello , Mrs Wolters ,
my name is J &quot; urgen Schumacher
and I am from $ C $ S $ S
I think , we still have to fix some appointments
which is the reason why I am calling you .
the thing is , that there are eight appointments we somehow have to find the times for
and I was thinking of Wednesday , Thursday in the first week of May
just a moment , in the first week of May right after May day ,
no , that does not suit me because I will be away on holiday with my family then .
what appointments do mean anyway ,
that course in business English , I guess .
maybe we should arrange it so then that we say ,
okay we fix four dates for May and another four dates for June ,
as it is good to be able to revise , especially with foreign languages .
yes , that is quite a good idea ,
so , the first week does not suit you ,
how about the nineteenth , the twentieth and the twenty first week then .
are you free some time then ,
which dates would suit you best ?
well , I am absolutely free in the nineteenth and twentieth week .
personally I would suggest the twentieth week , as we could form a block of four dates then ,
that would be four dates in May ,
that is , from Monday , the sixteenth , to Thursday , the nineteenth ,
it that okay with you ?
Monday the sixteenth to Thursday nineteenth ,
to tell the truth , I would prefer to do it from Tuesdays to Fridays as Monday is a bit inconvenient with me .
what do you think of it ?
okay , that suits fine too , no objection ,
all we still have to do now is finding the dates for June ,
when would it suit you ?
well ,
from Monday to Friday in the twenty fourth week of June we will meet at the annual conference in Vienna anyway .
how about the twenty third week ,
Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday would be best ,
would that suit you ?
yes , that would suit me ,
the question is ,
however , whether we should better take the twenty fifth week instead as we would have exactly a month in between then .
yes , the twenty fifth week would suit me too
I would even be free on Monday then ,
I could take it too then ,
I suggest we take Monday ,
Tuesday ,
Wednesday and Thursday in the twenty fifth week for another block .
yes , fine , at what time do you want me to ask the teacher to be there ?
it is private tuition , as it is appropriate for senior businessmen ,
and therefore you can ask the teacher to come when you please .
I think he would teach for two or three hours in the morning ,
have a lunch break , and then teach for another three hours
the question is , when you should like to start and when you should like to finish ?
yes , free in the morning
well , I suggest from ten to twelve and then we could perhaps have a lunch break for about an hour and then again from one to four ,
would that suit you ?
yes , that would suit me fine
shall we keep this schedule for the dates in June as well ?
well , for the dates in June
that is a good question
is there an alternative to that at all ,
I mean , could not we perhaps do it in one go in the afternoons to keep the mornings free as otherwise the whole day would be booked up .
well ,
the whole day is booked up anyway because such an intensive tuition in business English naturally takes a whole day .
but I can certainly understand you though ,
but I think , if we postpone it a little ,
say , from eleven $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M , lunch break then , and then from two to five $ P- $ M
yes , that suits me too
we can do it like this ,
so it is from eleven $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M and later on again from two to five $ P- $ M .
okay ,
fine then we meet from Tuesday the seventeenth to Friday the twentieth of May ,
from ten to twelve and then again from one to four
and in the first week in May , Monday the twentieth to Thursday ,
the twenty third ,
from eleven $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M respectively and then from two to five $ P- $ M
fine , we have made it at last ,
I am glad .
okay , we will also meet at the annual conference in Vienna then , and wait , at this tuition before that ,
do you think we should make some preparations for this course in business English or are you doing something along these lines ?
not really preparations ,
I have to talk to that teacher again ,
I will call him up again right away ,
and then I will let you know , okay ?
okay , let us do it like this ,
I wish you a nice holiday ,
you said , you would go away in May , did not you ,
see you at our joint tuition ,
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , Mrs Pohl ,
this is Silke Ostermann speaking .
I would like to discuss our joint business English course with you .
hello , Mrs Ostermann ,
nice , you called ,
right , we really have to discuss that .
well , we have to arrange seven dates ,
basically ,
would you prefer to hold it on , say , individual days or shall we hold it en bloc ?
well , the thing is , it will take eight days ,
that is , as there eight days we would have to include the weekend if we held it on bloc .
yes , I quite agree with you ,
well , I think , that also goes for us ,
I am not quite selfless ,
would , say , two appointments for four days suit you ?
I think ,
that it will be necessary to have some things prepared at home , especially in English , that is ,
homework will have to be given ,
and I think , it would be better to hold it weekly ,
that is , one class or at most two classes a week ,
simply because of all the work , that has to be done at home .
I see , well , so we hold it on , say , maximally two days ,
so that they have time to revise something and to prepare themselves ,
so that it is going to take a longer period of time in consequence .
is that right ?
I think , that would be the best solution .
okay , shall we start right at the beginning of May then ?
would it suit you right on Monday and Tuesday , the second and third of May ?
well , the thing is , I have got no time the first week of May .
but we could well start in the second week of May .
well , then I would say , right on Monday , Tuesday before Ascension day , the ninth and the tenth .
yes , I think that would not be bad ,
Ascension day is free ,
they can do some work then ,
yes , great , we will fix them both .
fine , that will give them some time .
and then in the twentieth week on Monday and Tuesday as well ?
yes , that would suit me too .
yes , fine , then it is Whitsun ,
and I would say , we continue right after Whit Monday ,
so that there will not be so much time in between .
that is another problem for me ,
we will have find another solution for that ,
how about the week after ?
well , I have got no time in the twenty second week ,
besides , it is Corpus-Christi then ,
how about the sixth and the seventh in the twenty third week ?
yes , that is fine too .
fine , then we have already got six dates in all ,
the week after in the annual conference in Vienna , where we will go together ,
how about the twentieth and twenty first of June then ?
well , I would say , it is fine ,
let us take that too .
yes , wonderful , we have got the dates fixed then .
that is , eight single dates in May and June ,
I think the time is pretty convenient , is not it ?
yes , I think , it is not bad ,
they only thing we still should discuss is , how we organize the course itself .
well , I think we should best arrange a personal date
so that we do not have to do it on the phone now ,
to talk about the subject matter in detail .
yes , one could well do that over a nice supper ,
and we could have a drink in our own time afterwards ,
what do you think ?
I think , that is a splendid idea ,
so we will arrange another date ,
we could meet whenever we both have time ,
and then we will talk about the subject matter ,
okay , Mrs Pohl ?
fine , okay , all right ,
I am glad ,
okay , all right ,
see you ,
bye .
bye .
Billen speaking ,
hello .
yes hello , Mrs Billen ,
this is G &quot; oren speaking .
we wanted to talk about the conversation course for executives .
we are expected to plan that together .
there were six dates in June and July .
do you already have an idea how to do it ?
right , the question is , whether we should spread it over several weeks or do it en bloc .
what do you think of it ?
well , I have been thinking about that too .
I would prefer individual dates to doing it en bloc , actually .
yes , right , I think so too .
how are things with you ,
are there any dates that are completely out of the question for you ?
well , I have got no time on Corpus-Christi at the beginning of June on the one hand .
besides I am going on an excursion to Frankfurt from the twenty seventh to the thirtieth .
so I have got no time then either .
and then there is the congress in Zurich that we will attend together from the fifth to the seventh of July .
and from the twenty second on I have a holiday ,
I am quite booked up actually .
I have got no time in the middle of June ,
from the tenth to fourteenth I have got a further education course in Berlin
so I will not be here then either
well , which day would suit you for the seminar ?
would the Thursdays do ?
six dates ?
well , let me have a look .
would we start on the ninth then ?
yes , the ninth would not be bad ,
yes , I should say so .
let us fix it as our first date , okay ?
yes , that is good .
and we should also fix the Thursday right after it , the sixteenth ?
yes , exactly .
the sixteenth is fine .
that would be the second one .
and the third one on the twenty third ?
yes , that would be just right .
but then the week after you have a holiday ?
yes , unfortunately I will not be here on Thursday .
well , the following week I will be away .
that is the seventh of June .
right , the next possible date is only the fourteenth of July then ,
is that okay ?
yes , that would be okay .
so that is the fourth date .
and we could fix the fifth one for the twenty first .
and after that I have a holiday .
so we still have to find a day for the sixth one .
yes , the question is , whether we should add a Wednesday ,
right at the beginning or maybe at the end ?
what do you think of it ?
yes , or maybe Friday , the first of July ,
well , I think , that is not so good ,
it is the end of the week after all ,
and many actually start the weekend a little earlier then .
maybe a Wednesday is really better .
yes , okay ,
which Wednesday would you suggest .
maybe some time in the middle .
the twenty second perhaps , okay ?
perhaps we could fix the first Wednesday .
that would be the eighth of July .
yes , that is also possible .
certainly .
shall we fix the eighth of June then ?
yes , I should say so .
two days running at the beginning is probably not bad after all .
yes , I think you are right .
the people will still be highly motivated then .
let us do it like this .
shall I recapulate the dates once more ?
I think , I have put them down .
but let me have a look .
it is the eighth and the ninth of June , the sixteenth of June and the twenty third .
in July it is the fourteenth and the twenty first .
have you got the same ?
yes , I have got the same .
shall we do it like this ?
yes , I think so .
will you pass on the information or do you want me to do it ?
I can write a letter ,
okay let us do it like this .
then all I still have to do is to say goodbye .
yes , goodbye then , Mrs Billen .
well .
it is about the conversation course
and well , what would you say ,
shall we do it all in one go or on several single days ?
good morning , first of all , Mrs M &quot; uller Schniepenpiepel .
morning , Mr B &quot; onsch .
well , what do you have in mind ?
well , I would be in favour of doing it all in one go .
I think it would be better .
I would say two seminars at two weekends .
I would not object to that , for once
especially as my father &apos; s on holiday
and so there will not be any more directives from him .
would you first give me the days on which you are already booked ?
that may be better for our planning .
well , there is total emptiness on my schedule ,
basically I am free all the time
except from the fifth to the seventh of July , when we will be at a congress in Zurich together ,
and from the tenth to the fourteenth of June .
there is a series of further training courses on business communication in Berlin then .
okay , I would suggest we take two successive weekends .
I would like to arrange them for July .
say , Friday to Sunday , the eighth to the tenth and the fifteenth to the seventeenth ,
how do you feel about that ?
basically I have got no objection to that .
shall we fix that or is it too much stress for you because of the congress ?
my pen does not work , you see .
that is the eighth to the tenth and the fifteenth to the seventeenth of July .
this would cause problems similar to those we had with our last arrangement ,
to tell the truth I dislike coming home from a congress and having to attend some seminar immediately afterwards on principle ,
especially as my schedule is completely empty .
so June would also be possible .
okay but then we would have to spread out the seminar ,
well , that is not that good .
right , then let us bring the whole thing forward .
what dates do you suggest ?
how about the twenty fifth and twenty sixth calendar week ?
well no , that is nonsense ,
the twenty fourth and twenty fifth ,
that are the weekends from the seventeenth to the nineteenth and from the twenty fourth and the twenty sixth of June .
apart from the fact that I will be on an excursion to Frankfurt from the twenty seventh to the thirtieth ,
well , okay , I am agreed ,
in fact , it is all the same to me .
as for me we can take these dates .
what are you excursing about ?
it is called media and the press
I see .
shall we fix these two weekends then ?
what is it about ?
what are you talking ?
media and the press .
well , that is not the subject now , is it ?
let us talk about the dates .
have you ever been told that you are obsessed with work ?
we should rather revert to our subject now , Mr B &quot; onsch .
so , how about the two weekends ?
fine , then I would say we fix them .
okay . fine .
well , who is organizing that excursion to Frankfurt ?
no idea ,
I do not know ,
I am sorry ,
I am merely going along .
what do you mean
no idea ,
I am sorry ,
I do not know
I am merely going along
yes , that is exactly it ,
do you want me to repeat it , or what ?
yes , it may also be good for the recording if that was recorded once more .
well , to come back to the weekends and the six dates ,
we have fixed the sixteenth to the nineteenth and the twenty fourth to the twenty sixth ,
and you agreed to it .
therefore I would like to say goodbye to you ,
goodbye Mr B &quot; onsch ,
have a nice day .
no , do not be rash ,
have you talked to the caretaker to see if it will be possible at all
that is not the point ,
of course it will be possible .
well , I must say , my experiences have been otherwise ,
well , normally , your talent for organization will meet its limits sooner or later
what does the caretaker say to it ?
that he does not care about dates .
even my father would be satisfied with that .
may I say goodbye now ?
in a friendly way goodbye .
I would love to keep on listening to your sonorous voice .
hello ,
this is Meyer L &quot; ubke speaking .
hello .
this is Meyer Kuckuck speaking .
Mrs Meyer-L &quot; ubke I am phoning you about the following .
we still have to fix the dates for or series of talks on data protection and data security ,
to be held once a week in fact ,
how do you feel about July and August .
well , it would suit me if we got it over with rather soon .
I was thinking of one talk a week ,
so that I would have a bit more time in the middle of August as there also is the conference on artificial intelligence in Vienna that we will attend together ,
and I will also be away the weekend before .
which is why I was thinking of a weekly arrangement which could perhaps start in the first weeks of July already .
yes , that would suit me too ,
what do you think of Wednesday the sixth of July ?
well , that would suit me ,
but I thought that each of the talks could be held on the same day of the week
and the only day on which I would be free every week is Monday .
that does not suit me , unfortunately .
I would therefore suggest Wednesday instead ,
but as I see it , it can not be arranged .
as you are not free on every Wednesday we will have to find different days for the talks .
how about Wednesday the sixth then ,
would it suit you ?
yes , Wednesday the sixth would suit me .
Wednesday , the sixth , at what time ?
eleven is always a good time for a talk ?
in the morning ?
yes , that suits me too .
eleven in the morning .
fine .
what about the Wednesday of the following week , the thirteenth ?
well , that does not suit me .
I will be in Cologne then .
there is an open day then .
but we could perhaps switch to Monday the eleventh ,
well , I still have to see the caretaker about that .
yes sure , I am available the whole week ,
we could also fix another day .
if Monday suits you I am agreed .
at eleven again ?
yes , eleven would suit me fine .
Wednesday the following week might be suitable ,
so that we may have somewhat regular intervals ,
Wednesday , the twentieth .
yes , Wednesday the twentieth is fine too ,
and eleven o &apos;clock as well .
in the morning I will have to go to the hairdresser &apos; s with my daughter then ,
I could make it ,
at eleven o &apos;clock , all right .
okay , I am also available the following week .
so Wednesday , the twenty seventh would be okay ?
well , I have got a meeting on Thursday and I still have to prepare quite a few things for it .
but I think I will make it anyway ,
so we could stick to Wednesday .
we still have to find two more dates then .
I am also available the first week of August .
I am not .
we have got our summer school on applied linguistics in T &quot; ubingen then .
that is very inconvenient .
so the entire week is impossible for me actually .
I would take the following week instead , when I am free at any time basically .
well , I will be away from Friday , the twelfth , on ,
on private matters in fact .
but I would be free on Wednesday the tenth .
fine .
then I would say we decide on eleven o &apos;clock on Wednesday again , okay ?
yes , fine , we still need one , two , three , four , five still one more date ,
I could make it if we arranged it for the afternoon .
yes , sure .
we could certainly also arrange it for Thursday that week , or so ,
that is probably not that bad ,
as I do not know whether you will be able to follow the talk when you are still indulging in the memories of your holidays .
yes , I would prefer that too actually ,
I will still have to unpack and so on .
and you have to recover from your holidays after all .
all right .
fine . let us fix Thursday then .
the time is all the same to me then .
then I would say eleven o &apos;clock again , okay ,
so that we have got at least some regularity .
yes , Mrs Meyer , what did you say your name was ?
Meyer Kuckuck .
okay , Mrs Meyer Kuckuck , we have got all dates fixed then ,
I would say , I will see the caretaker about the rooms
and we will meet on Wednesday , the sixth , for the first talk .
and well , I hope that the whole thing will be a success .
thanks a lot , Mrs Meyer L &quot; ubke .
goodbye .
a very good day , Mr Leonhard
I am phoning about our series of talks on the topic of data protection and data security .
we still have to fix some dates for it .
and as we probably do not have time on all days ,
there are at least a few days on which I am already booked up ,
I would say we fix the dates now .
hello Mr Schmidt .
I suggest , you tell me when you are booked up first
and then we put it down in our diaries .
okay , we can certainly do that
we should best do it week by week perhaps , okay
a date a week ,
thus we do not have to write down everything .
so the Monday of the first week of July is not possible for me .
I will be at the state computer centre then .
yes , okay , I am free the whole week .
shall we fix a particular day ,
say every Tuesday or Wednesday ?
are you always free on Tuesdays ?
I will just have to check that .
no , it is impossible in the third week .
it would not suit me in the thirty fourth week .
how about Mondays ?
well , that is also bad
I am booked up twice then .
I think we can not do it on the same day every week .
and then I will give you my dates .
right .
in the twenty seventh week I am booked on Monday ,
as I told you , I will be at the state computer centre then .
the in the twenty ninth week I am booked on Monday and Thursday .
I will be in Frankfurt then .
then in the thirty first week I am booked from Monday to Friday ,
it is the summer school , applied linguistics in T &quot; ubingen then .
and in the thirty fourth week I am booked from Tuesdays to Thursdays ,
there is a conference on artificial intelligence in Vienna .
both of us be there actually .
okay , I have got no appointment in the twenty seventh week ,
it is the open day at the $ W $ D $ R on the thirteenth in the twenty eighth week .
in the twenty ninth week I have got no appointments either
I have got a meeting with a business consulting firm .
and in the thirty second week I have got an appointment from Friday to Tuesday .
well , then I would say we fix the Tuesday of the twenty seventh week .
yes , agreed .
when was it , you are booked in the twenty eighth week ?
I am booked on Wednesday .
so Thursday the fourteenth is possible again .
yes , right , let us fix it again .
Thursday of the twenty ninth week as well ?
on the twenty first ?
and then Thursday of the thirtieth week too
or are you booked then ?
no , that is impossible for me ,
we should fix the Wednesday instead .
well , that should be okay .
the whole thirty first week is impossible for you .
yes , exactly .
and then we have still got another one in the thirty third week , again on a Thursday .
well , except once we will always meet on a Thursday .
that is wonderful , is not it ?
wonderful , we have fitted all dates in .
okay , see you at the conference on artificial intelligence .
at the latest .
yes , okay .
bye . see you .
bye .
hello , Mrs Sonntag ,
you surely know why I am calling ,
because of our joint series of talks , actually .
we will have to arrange six individual dates .
yes , well , did you plan to hold them once a week in any case ?
so that we have to allow six weeks .
exactly .
that is going to cause some problems for the planning as it would certainly be finished much sooner if we did it as a kind of block seminar .
are there any days on which you are absolutely booked up ?
well , I could give you a few days on which I am not available .
there are the twenty eighth and twenty ninth for example ,
well in the next month ,
I have got a meeting then .
I am not available then in any case .
and I am just as booked up in August .
that would be from Friday the twelfth to Tuesday the sixteenth .
and then there are still three more days on which I am not available a little later in August ,
from the twenty third to the twenty fifth .
yes , we both have that date for the conference on the twenty third , twenty fifth .
shall we hold the talks at weekly intervals ,
I think , we should best start right away now .
if it is perhaps possible for you to fix date for the first week of July already ,
we could see , how far we we will get .
well , I have got no time on Monday the fourth of July .
otherwise I would be free until the eighteenth of July ,
then I will be on an excursion for two days .
okay , then you should be free on Wednesday or Thursday at the beginning of July , on the sixth or seventh of July ?
exactly .
but I would prefer the seventh then ,
I would have some more time for preparation then .
okay .
how much time shall we allow for the conference ?
shall we start in the morning ?
say , at ten o &apos;clock perhaps .
yes ,
from ten to twelve ,
and then a lunch break ,
and then again from two to four or from two to five in the afternoon .
what do you think about that ?
yes , I think , from two to five will suffice .
we will have four hours then .
so we could already fix this date for the seventh of July .
okay , that is Thursday the seventh of July from ten to twelve $ A- $ M and from two to four $ P- $ M then .
fine .
I would further suggest Wednesday the thirteenth of July .
unfortunately , I have got no time on that day ,
it is the open day at the $ W $ D $ R in Cologne .
maybe we could try to take the Thursday again .
we should have exactly a week in between then .
fine .
let us fix Thursday , the fourteenth of July , from two to four $ P- $ M then .
fine , how about the Thursday after ?
would that suit you too ?
well , I will have finished the excursion only two days before ,
okay .
we should best take the same hours .
the week after will be a bit more difficult for me ,
as I said , I have got a meeting then .
but maybe we could try the fourth of August , the Thursday after .
would that suit you ?
well , it is my summer school then .
exactly from the first to fifth of August in fact .
but I would suggest we hold a talk before that already ,
and what about Tuesday then ?
would that be too tight for you ?
Tuesday would not be a problem for me ,
that would be perfectly possible ,
that would be Tuesday the second of August then .
and we should best fix the same hours .
no , not Tuesday the second ,
I meant Tuesday , the twenty sixth ,
I will be away from the first to to the fifth .
I see , okay .
that would suit me too .
so it is Tuesday , the twenty sixth .
that is our fourth date then ,
that means , that we still need two more dates for August .
fine .
let us see to it that we do not have too much time between Tuesday , the twenty sixth and the next date .
yes , my next suggestion would be a Monday perhaps ,
lest it gets too long , Monday , eighth of August .
yes , I will fix , Monday , eighth of August , from ten to twelve .
as usual , then .
okay .
then there is my long weekend from Friday on ,
therefore I would have no time then .
I would suggest the eighteenth then as that would leave you some time for preparation .
Thursday , the eighteenth will be our final talk ,
shall we allow some time afterwards
in case there should be some questions from the participants ?
well , I think , it would be best if we left the date in the morning as it is ,
and simply left the afternoon open ,
that is , allowed an open end .
okay .
from ten to twelve and an open end in the afternoon .
fine .
well , then we have fitted all dates in .
if something crops up on your part , please let me know as soon as possible so that we can settle that in good time , as July is already near ,
as I said , I will be away for almost a week in August ,
and so the schedule might get a bit tight .
yes , that is no problem ,
I will inform you in good time .
and otherwise , I think we could keep it like that for now .
okay , thank you and goodbye .
yes , goodbye .
Schottemeyer speaking .
hello Mrs Schottemeyer
this is Marion Pusch speaking .
ah yes , Mrs Pusch .
good morning ,
nice of you to call .
you surely know , why I am calling ,
we still have to plan the series of lectures .
yes , sure ,
I have already got the thing lying on my desk .
I would have called you too during the next hours .
well , I think , we already have a draft actually .
yes , that is just how I see it .
well , I think , we should hold six meetings ,
in fact , it would be very convenient if we met once a week .
yes , it would also be very nice if we could do it regularly .
maybe on a certain day of the week ,
that would surely be practical .
that is just what I think ,
I hope we can fit it into both our schedules .
shall we start fixing the times now ?
yes , that might be fine .
we should best start in July .
how do you feel about Wednesdays ?
well , Wednesdays .
the thirteenth does not suit me , I am afraid .
but apart from that , Wednesdays are fine .
right . maybe we find another day ,
however , the problem for me is that I will be spending the whole first week of August from Monday to Friday at the summer school ,
and well , so it would not suit me then .
okay , we may have to drop this first week then .
how about the other days , Wednesdays for example ?
the other Wednesdays .
do they suit you ?
on August twenty fourth we will be at the conference together .
so that is certainly also bad then .
Saturday , for example ?
yes , Saturday would suit me too .
maybe we should arrange things so that we do not fix a certain day of the week once and for all but choose a different day for each week .
what do you think of that ?
yes , you are surely right ,
I have already got enough to do then .
I would really also prefer to do it on a workday .
right , shall we start next week then ?
well , I mean , this week surely will not be possible .
shall we start next week then ?
on Monday , the eleventh that week ?
yes , that is a very good idea ,
we can do that .
shall we fix July eleventh for the first appointment ?
yes , that would suit me fine .
let us say the first of July .
on July eleventh .
yes , on the eleventh .
yes , fine .
right , shall we fix the second date for the week after ?
when does it suit you then ?
basically I am free the whole week long .
well , on Monday and Tuesday I will still be on an excursion in Frankfurt ,
and I would like Wednesday for regeneration ,
so , maybe on Thursday .
yes , that suits me fine .
fine , let us fix the twenty first .
yes .
actually , I do not mind when we meet the week after ,
I am free then .
that suits me fine as I am having a meeting on Thursday and Friday
so it would be very convenient for me if we could meet at the beginning of the week .
Monday would be best as I still had time to prepare for the meeting then .
yes , that is no problem at all ,
yes , exactly .
shall we say Monday the twenty fifth then ?
yes .
fine .
we still need three appointments now ,
we should best fix them for August ,
although , as I said , I have got no time during the first week of August .
okay , let us begin right in week starting on August eighth .
okay .
how about Tuesday ninth for example ?
very good . that suits me fine .
okay , let us fix that then .
fine . unfortunately I am free only from Wednesday on the week after .
does that suit you ?
or what do you think of my being free only from Wednesday on ?
well , that is no problem at all ,
I have got time then .
that is , we can easily towards the end of the week ,
Thursday or Friday , whichever you prefer .
then I would say , we take Tuesday .
yes , fine , we can do that ,
that is the fifth appointment , is not it ?
yes , exactly .
shall we fix the last appointment for the time after our joint conference in Vienna ?
as a kind of final in August before we go on the summer holidays ?
yes , that would suit me fine ,
as I am going away on a holiday the following week ,
so that I would like to do it still in that week .
shall we say Friday the twenty sixth ?
yes , we can do that .
thus we will get it all done in August ,
that would be nice .
I will put that down then .
okay , Mrs Pusch , I am relieved we found the times despite our schedules ,
and I thank you for calling ,
see you on July eleventh .
exactly .
I thank you too
see you .
see you . goodbye .
goodbye .
Borucki speaking .
Klaus speaking .
hello .
we still have to fix some appointments for September and October .
ah yes , the appointments for September and October for our joint visit to the $ I $ A $ A in Frankfurt .
among other things , exactly .
right , Mr Klaus .
I have got the following problem .
the $ I $ A $ A lasts nine days on four of which I am already booked unfortunately ,
in fact at the two weekends .
well that should not be a problem ,
we could meet on the twelfth , the thirteenth or the fourteenth then .
well , yes , I am free any time then .
when would it suit you best ?
well , that is all the same to me as well actually .
let us meet on Monday ,
we could probably add a day or two if we like it there .
I think that is a splendid idea .
okay , excellent .
at the $ I $ A $ A on Monday the twelfth .
of course .
okay , fine .
shall we say ten o &apos;clock ?
okay .
right , so far so good .
then we still need some further dates for a meeting in October and for a weekend seminar .
however , the weekends in October are quite a problem for me .
to be exact , only the weekend from the fourteenth , fifteenth , sixteenth would be possible actually .
we could only hold a two day seminar at that weekend ,
a seminar on the fifteenth and sixteenth .
the Friday is not possible for me .
oh , I think two days should be enough time for it .
I should say so too .
that is the weekend seminar then .
we will hold it on Saturday the fifteenth and Sunday the sixteenth .
okay ?
yes , very good .
let us also start in the morning already .
though we could certainly hold the weekend seminar in September already .
but it will not make much difference .
well , I think it is better October .
in any case we still have to arrange another date for a meeting in October .
when can you spare a whole day in October ?
well , I have got much more opportunities then .
I am relatively free then .
suggest one then .
well , I think , it would be good if we left some time before the weekend seminar ,
that is between the meeting and the weekend seminar .
I would therefore suggest Tuesday the fourth for example .
yes , very good .
and at what time ?
that is all the same to me .
but no , I am only free until one $ P- $ M on Tuesday mornings .
let us fix a time in the morning then .
first thing in the morning , at eight , with a nice cup of coffee .
okay , I will come to your place then .
okay .
you bring the rolls .
sure . keep the jam warm .
sure .
that is it , is not it ?
I would say goodbye then .
right , that is it .
goodbye .
bye .
hello , Mrs Schmitz .
this is Mrs Star speaking ,
I still have to arrange a few dates for September and October nineteen ninety four .
there is the joint visit to the $ I $ A $ A on the one hand and a meeting and a week seminar on the other .
yes , Mrs Star ,
it is very kind of you to call .
I also wanted to call you on this matter .
let us fix the date for the $ I $ A $ A first .
when would it suit you ?
well , the $ I $ A $ A is taking place from the tenth of September to the eighteenth of September .
and I would be free from Friday , the twelfth of September to the sixteenth of September .
well ,
apart from Tuesday the twelfth , no wait ,
the thirteenth of September and Thursday the fifteenth I would still be free too .
how about some time in between ?
when did you say you had time ?
otherwise I am free .
well , then I would suggest Wednesday the fourteenth of September .
yes , that looks pretty good ,
let us fix Wednesday the fourteenth of September .
okay .
and how about the meeting in October ?
when would you be free then ?
well , I would be free on Tuesday the fourth of October then .
and after that only from the seventeenth to the twenty fourth of October .
right , Tuesday the fourth of October would suit me fine .
that is the day immediately after the day of German unity .
yes . fine .
I would be free from eight $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M on Tuesday .
after that I am booked up unfortunately .
how about you ?
well , I have got nothing in particular planned for Tuesday
okay , let us simply say Tuesday , ten o &apos;clock for our meeting then .
would you agree ?
yes .
do you know how long the meeting might take ?
no , I do not know exactly unfortunately ,
I suppose that it will take about one or two hours .
yes , that is okay .
and now about the weekend seminar .
yes , what would you suggest ?
I am just checking the weekends .
well , the first and the second of October would be fine .
yes , that would me suit fine too .
or the fifteenth or sixteenth of October .
yes , that is also fine .
I am still free then too .
how do you feel about it ?
yes , that is a very suggestion ,
I agree with you .
right , then we are agreed .
Saturday and Sunday , the fifteenth and sixteenth of October for our weekend seminar .
yes , right , fine .
at nine o &apos;clock ?
yes , nine o &apos;clock is fine .
right bye then .
yes , bye .
well , then we could plan the joint visit to the motor show now .
just a moment , I am just collecting my papers .
now , all right ,
well , as I see , the $ I $ A $ A lasts from Sunday , September the tenth , to Sunday , September the eighteenth .
I am free at the weekends then actually ,
though Thursday and Friday are bad for me .
how about Monday the twelfth ?
yes , that is okay .
I have no date then .
fine , let us do that .
right , we should best take the whole day , okay ?
yes , certainly , we have to schedule an all day visit for that .
we will start out early in the morning ,
and settle it all then .
well , as for the date for the meeting in October ,
I am afraid I have got no time from the fifth to the fourteenth then .
could not we hold it on Tuesday , October the fourth , immediately after the Friday .
that would be okay ,
so we would have that fixed then already .
okay , fine , the meeting , all right .
I will put that down .
time ?
are you restricted on Tuesday ?
I am probably only free in the morning .
we would have to meet at eight in the morning already .
all right .
that suits me fine .
this meeting is at eight o &apos;clock on Tuesday , October fourth .
I will put that down .
would the twenty second and the twenty third suit you for the weekend seminar ?
twenty second and twenty third of October .
no , that does not suit me .
I have got a date on Saturday , the twenty second of October .
I have got no time then at all .
I am just checking when I am free in October at all .
well ,
I am almost restricted to either the weekend of October the first and second or the weekend of October the fifteenth and sixteenth .
well , I would say the fifteenth and sixteenth .
okay .
all right .
the fifteenth and the sixteenth suit me too .
let us hold the weekend seminar then .
all right .
we can also plan it on Tuesday then .
okay I would say , we have got our dates for the next four month fixed then .
all right .
bye , Mr Wenrich .
goodbye .
Kalbe speaking .
hello , Mrs Kalbe .
I am calling to fix an appointment for the $ I $ A $ A in Frankfurt with you .
the beginning of the week would be more interesting for me .
I have got not time on Tuesday evening though ,
actually , I would very much prefer Monday .
well ,
if we go to the $ I $ A $ A when it opens on Saturday the tenth of September until Monday the twelfth we may have one day too few to go through the whole programme .
well , if we included Monday and Tuesday morning would that be enough for you ?
fine , then I would ask my secretary to reserve a flight for us .
would that suit you ?
yes , absolutely ,
so that we can meet early at the $ I $ A $ A on Monday morning .
fine , see you .
bye .
Mrs Schmitz ?
yes ?
well , I am phoning again about an appointment for a meeting in October .
would you be free for me some time then ?
well in October there is first of all the public holiday and I also wanted to go on holiday then .
so I would not be available until the middle of the month at least .
how do you feel about the middle of the month then ?
well , I would suggest the week from the seventeenth to the twenty third .
how about Thursday or Friday then ?
unfortunately , I have got fixed commitments on Thursdays , well , at lunchtime ,
and you should come especially for the meeting ,
well , I would suggest Friday morning perhaps .
yes , Friday morning .
would it suit you if I were in your office at eight o &apos;clock ?
would that be the twenty first October ,
did I get that right ?
yes , at your place at eight o &apos;clock on the twenty first .
fine .
I will make a note of that .
bye .
bye .
Mrs Schmitz ?
hello , Mrs Kalbe .
well , I am calling you again concerning a weekend seminar .
weekend seminar , oh yes , right , the weekend seminar , exactly .
well , as we have already got some appointments fixed we must see if we can find a free weekend .
when would it suit you ?
have you already thought of something ?
well , the October is quite booked by now ,
there is also a meeting at the $ B $ M $ F $ T ,
maybe still in September in the week after the $ I $ A $ A
that would be the twenty third until the twenty fifth .
unfortunately I have already got a visit to Dortmund then .
would the weekend after suit you too ?
do you mean from the thirtieth of September to the second of October ?
yes . exactly .
that would suit me fine ,
only that I could not come before Friday evening .
yes , that would suit me .
on Friday evening .
then we would at least have two full days for the meeting .
fine , Mrs Kalbe ,
see you at the end of September then .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
this is Heinrich speaking .
and I am calling about a five day trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S in Mannheim .
yes , M &quot; uller here .
that should not be a problem ,
we only have to take care for when we fix the dates , as my schedule is rather tight .
well , January would quite suit me , as I am already rather busy in February ,
well , I do not know whether January suits you .
the second week of January or the time between the eighteenth and twenty fourth might be possible .
I would prefer the second week as I have already got some dates after the eighteenth ,
that is not possible for me .
shall we say , from the eighteenth to the twenty second ?
well , I would say , is not it possible from the twentieth on ?
as it does not suit me on the eighteenth ,
that is from the twentieth and then to the twenty fifth ?
I have got an appointment on the twenty fifth ,
so , we could fix the twentieth until the twenty fourth .
well , the twentieth until the twenty fourth is okay .
that can be arranged .
okay .
let us keep it like that .
but we still should fix another day for a preliminary meeting .
maybe in the second week of January ?
how about the tenth of January ?
on Tuesday ?
would that be okay ?
the tenth of January suits me fine .
we can fix that .
okay , then I would say , we fix the tenth ,
and then we still have to see about the supper together afterwards .
would the end of January at the end suit you somehow it would be the last week of February ?
I would suggest , Friday , the twenty seventh then .
Friday , the twenty seventh is okay .
well , we can arrange it like that .
yes , we can fix that ,
and then I would say , see you .
yes , goodbye .
M &quot; ockl speaking , hello .
this is Schmidt speaking , hello .
I would like to make an appointment for a trip to Mannheim with you .
ah yes , Mr Schmidt ,
you are calling concerning the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim .
yes , could you give me a time when I can visit you ?
well ,
the thing is ,
the trip will last five days as we also have to go to the $ B $ A $ S $ F from there .
I see ,
which week would be most convenient then ?
well , I think that the five days may probably involve a weekend .
I am relatively free in February .
I have got a rather tight schedule in January .
what do you think of Friday February tenth ?
well , I must be back again on the fifteenth .
can we perhaps meet one or two days earlier ?
Thursday ninth ?
yes , we can do that .
Thursday ninth until Monday thirteenth inclusive .
we would also have time for supper on Monday thirteenth in the evening then .
yes , okay , that suits me fine .
I am coming back only in the evening on the eighth ,
but Thursday morning would be okay , if it is not too early .
we should be able to get hold of a cup of coffee .
I suppose we also need a preliminary meeting .
in the week before .
is that okay ?
Wednesday the first , for example ?
Wednesday the first is all right .
shall we say , ten o &apos;clock ?
ten o &apos;clock .
I would best come to you so that I can have a look at the rooms .
excellent .
see you on February first , Mr Schmidt .
bye .
okay , bye .
hello , my name is Kr &quot; ummel ,
I am phoning about the dates in January and February .
yes , Wegener speaking ,
well , make a suggestion .
right , the beginning of the second week of January for example would suit me for a preliminary meeting
that is on Monday the ninth for example .
yes , that would be fine ,
but on the other hand the following two weeks are not suitable for holding the conference in Mannheim .
okay .
the first week of February might be suitable for the conference .
does that suit you too , from the sixth or seventh of February on ?
no , I am sorry .
there will be a congress in Munich then .
the whole February is so booked up , that no long trips can be taken .
it might be possible to go away from the thirtieth of January to the third of February .
I am sorry ,
I have got no time from the thirtieth of January to the thirty first of January .
I would be available on Wednesday the first of February at the earliest .
how many days is it ?
I would have another date on Tuesday the seventh ,
well , does it suit you ?
yes , that suits me fine .
we have fixed a date for the conference then ,
we should still need a date for the preliminary meeting .
it would be possible on the twenty third for example ,
that is a Monday .
that would well be possible , okay .
as far as I am concerned it is all right .
right , we should still need a date for a final dinner then .
would the weekend from the eleventh to the twelfth of February be possible for example .
there will be a quite a long time in between then ,
but it is possible , okay .
if you think there is too much time in between , we could bring the date forward a little .
some time in the week before for example ?
when would suit you then ?
considering the fact that we will start out on Monday , no that is Wednesday , and return on Sunday .
already Monday the sixth or after that Thursday the ninth or February the tenth would be possible .
but I think the first date , you mentioned , would be quite suitable .
okay , let us stick to Saturday the eleventh of February then .
yes , great , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
my name is Schmidt .
I am calling about the dates for the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim .
the conference , that involves a preliminary meeting before and a visit to the $ B $ A $ S $ F .
exactly .
could you give me your name again ,
for me to know that I am talking to the right person ?
my name is M &quot; uller and I work for Sauber and Co .
wonderful , I have got the right one then .
so it will of course be somewhat difficult to find a date for it .
we were thinking of January , February this year .
what time could you suggest ?
that would be the second week of January and the first week of February ,
that is the week extending from January into February .
well , otherwise it is bad .
how about you ?
well ,
the week in February from Monday the thirtieth to the third of February is absolutely inconvenient for me .
however , if we included the weekend , I could offer you to start on Thursday , February the second .
and then , just a moment , stay five days until Tuesday the seventh .
I will be at a congress in Munich then , unfortunately .
that is not possible .
the only five free days I would have are between the ninth to the sixteenth of February and otherwise in the first half of January .
in the first half of January or in the first half of February ?
in the first half of January .
well ,
then I could only offer you the time between January the seventh and January the twelfth or between January the seventeenth and January the twenty second .
the seventh to the twelfth would be fine .
excellent .
let us fix that right away ,
we will meet at the hotel in Mannheim then .
yes , fine , let us do it like that .
now it is getting difficult to arrange a preliminary meeting before that , of course ,
if you are only free at that particular time .
I am afraid , we will have to hold the preliminary meeting together with the meeting .
that is , on the sixth of January ?
well , that is a holiday actually ,
and I am a strict Catholic , so I really would not like to work on that day .
that is not work .
we are going there for pleasure .
you will not believe , what a nice preliminary meeting it is going to be .
so that I can go to church in the morning .
yes , that is okay with me .
I will be able to sleep long then ,
you will go to church ,
and then we both will come blissful to the preliminary meeting .
wonderful .
fine .
when would you be free once more for a supper ,
so that we can sum up all the results .
the week after would suit me .
it will not make no difference to me whether we meet on Friday the thirteenth ,
or better not ,
if you are such a strict Catholic , you are surely also terribly superstitious .
or on Monday , the sixteenth .
well , I am terribly sorry , but I will be in Berlin at that time
and will be at a congress there ,
but I remember that you were free at the beginning of February .
what do you think of the first of February ?
yes , fine .
that would suit me .
Wednesday , the first of February .
okay .
we could perhaps meet at the Goldener Adler at eight $ P- $ M then .
fine , I would prefer the Silberne Habicht , but
okay , let us fix the Silberne Habicht at eight $ P- $ M .
thank you .
all right , see you ,
bye .
hello ,
my name is Zehnpfenning ,
am I talking to Mr Schmuck ?
yes , that is me .
I am calling concerning the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim , and the corresponding visit to the $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen as well as the preliminary meetings before that and have supper together after that .
in fact , we have to consider for when and how we can arrange it .
I simply wanted to ask you , when it would suit you .
well , the first week is absolutely impossible .
that is , from the first to the sixth of January nineteen hundred and ninety five .
the week after would be possible .
well , the preceding preliminary meeting should not take that long .
I think four or five hours should do if we drag it out somewhat on Wednesday ,
that is Wednesday , the eleventh , if we could meet at about four $ P- $ M then ,
it would last until eight or nine $ P- $ M for once .
would that be possible for you ?
yes , that would be possible ,
that is Wednesday , the eleventh , at four $ P- $ M .
yes , that would suit me .
fine , let us fix that date .
and we could also consider how we arrange that ,
how about you ?
when can you spare five days running for the five day trip ,
so that we can arrange it together ?
between the seventeenth and the twenty fourth of January ,
that is from Tuesday to Tuesday .
that will be a problem for me , as I am already booked up on Wednesday the eighteenth and on Thursday the nineteenth ,
in fact I will be at the $ Z $ D $ F in Mainz on the eighteenth ,
and I have got a private appointment on the nineteenth .
well , we could certainly arrange it for the weekend ,
that is , from Friday , the twentieth to Tuesday , the twenty fourth , as far as I am concerned ,
or even to Wednesday the twenty fifth , if possible .
well , except for Wednesday , it is possible ,
therefore I would prefer Thursday ,
you should be free then if I got you right ,
and I really have to go there .
well , as I said , I am completely book up on a private matter on Thursday ,
in fact , it is my parents golden wedding anniversary ,
I have got to attend it .
but it would do ,
if we started out early on Friday morning , the twentieth , and returned on Tuesday the twenty fourth in the evening .
those are the necessary five days ,
and we should get everything done then actually .
I think so too .
so let us fix Friday the twentieth till Tuesday the twenty fourth including the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim .
right , let us meet on Friday the twentieth at about seven thirty in the morning to go there then .
yes , okay , that is possible .
where shall we meet best ?
we should best meet right at the main station in Mannheim .
I do not know yet , which train I will take and from where .
let us do it like this , we meet at the main station on platform one in Mannheim at seven thirty .
okay .
fine .
how do you feel about supper together afterwards .
we could hold a follow up meeting then .
we could exchange the experiences we will have made a bit then .
shall we fix that for January too ?
or shall we fix it for the beginning of February this year ?
what do you think ?
well , January would not suit me at all ,
I am already fully booked up then .
I would prefer February ,
some time in the middle of February would be best ,
some time at the beginning would not quite suit me either .
how about you ?
right , though I must say that a meeting such a long time after , is a bit of a problem for me ,
so I must say that I would really prefer the beginning of February .
however , I am booked up on the seventh and the eighth .
on the seventh I will be at a congress in Munich and on the eighth I will be at another congress in Frankfurt ,
so I have got only little time that week ,
but either the time between Wednesday ,
the first , and Monday ,
the sixth ,
or from the ninth to the fourteenth would suit me .
well , Thursday the ninth of February would suit me best .
yes , that would suit me too .
what time of day shall we fix ?
shall we meet in the evening or would you rather have dinner at lunchtime ?
no , I would rather have supper .
I am very busy during the day , you know ,
at about eight o &apos;clock or something would be best .
Thursday the ninth at eight $ P- $ M would be possible for me .
where would you like to meet me then ?
say at the Vier Jahreszeiten ?
oh , yes , I happen to know the Vier Jahreszeiten too ,
it is very pleasant .
okay , let us do it like this .
do you have any more questions ?
no , that is it actually
or do you want me to reserve a table
or will you do that ?
I will reserve a table .
luckily I know one of the waiters there .
he will choose a very nice table for us .
fine , that is all so far .
goodbye .
yes , okay ,
goodbye , Mr Zehnpfenning ,
goodbye , Mr Schmuck .
hello , this is Kunz speaking again .
we have got a five day trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim , together with a visit to the $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen fourthcoming ,
and before we go there , dear secretary , we still have to arrange a preliminary meeting ,
and now I would like to know ,
whether the first weekend of January , Saturday and Sunday , the seventh and the eighth would be possible .
I am sorry ,
I have got no time then .
does the preliminary meeting have to be at a weekend ,
or would it also be possible within the working week ?
within the working week would be possible as well .
well , afterwards I would still be free on the Monday , the ninth , the eleventh and the twelfth .
how about Wednesday January the eighteenth ?
Wednesday , the eighteenth of January ,
let me see .
yes , yes , we could .
what about the Thursday too ?
I have just discovered , that there is a visit to the $ Z $ D $ F in Mainz scheduled for that time .
no , that would not be possible .
perhaps on Tuesday , the twenty fourth of January ?
that would make it a bit tight for me ,
but okay , let us agree on Tuesday the twenty fourth for the preliminary meeting .
that five day trip is taking place in the first week of February .
from the first , second , third in the first week of February ?
and also over the weekend ?
is that possible then ?
yes , that is possible .
okay , that is wonderful .
that is from Wednesday , the first to Sunday , the fifth .
yes .
well , let me have a quick look .
I am rather free then .
could you suggest a date .
only the last week of February is possible for me ,
all other evenings are already booked up .
which day in particular do you have in mind ?
I suggest February , the twenty fourth .
fine , wonderful , at eight o &apos;clock ?
yes .
okay , do suggest a nice restaurant then .
well , I do not know my way around Mannheim that well .
maybe you could
you live there after all .
ah yes , I live there .
then I would simply say we go to the Maredo ,
we still know it from Bonn ,
and we meet there at eight .
at eight o &apos;clock , all right .
well , see you on the twenty fifth .
okay , bye .
yes , right , thank you .
bye .
yes , bye .
Str &quot; a &quot; sner speaking ,
what can I do for you ?
hello ,
this is Mrs Hempel speaking again .
I would like to arrange a five day trip to $ D $ G $ F $ S conference that is taking place in Mannheim .
and I think it would also be quite interesting to pay a short visit to the $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen .
how do you feel about it ?
the five day trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference was somehow from the seventeenth of January to the twenty fourth of January .
can that be possible ?
that can not be possible actually , as it says here , that I am booked up on Wednesday the eighteenth and the nineteenth ,
I made note of something going on at the $ Z $ D $ F in Mainz ,
well , I think we can fix it earlier in January ,
it would suit me fine from Saturday seventh , Sunday eight and so fourth on .
give me a helping hand once more ,
when is the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference ?
well , I think from Monday , the ninth on .
that does not suit me , because I have to go to a congress in Berlin over the long weekend .
how about the beginning of February for the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference .
yes , the beginning of February would suit me too .
that is from Wednesday the first to Monday inclusive , is not it ?
exactly .
from Wednesday , the first , to Monday , the sixth .
the question is , when we could get to together to prepare it ?
well , immediately before would be no problem for me .
that is , Monday , Tuesday and so on .
I would also have time the weekend before that .
the weekend would not quite suit me ,
I have got no time the days after it ,
how about Thursday , the twenty sixth ?
no , just then I have got a date for a meeting in Cologne ,
I can at best offer you Friday or the days before ,
that would also be possible .
yes , I think Friday would be quite all right ,
that is close enough to the date but also leaves us enough time , to make the necessary preparations .
shall we keep Friday ?
and so we have also got the trip in the bag now .
right .
afterwards we wanted to go out for supper actually ,
well , I do not know ,
would you be interested ?
yes , count me in .
I would like to do it right after the week , in which we come back from the conference .
how do you feel about Wednesday ?
Wednesday would not be possible for me ,
but I am still free on Thursday and Friday and the weekend .
and Monday , the thirteenth ?
yes , we can fix that .
say from six , seven $ P- $ M on .
do you know a restaurant , that would recommendable ?
I can only think of this little Bistro in Wilhelmstra &quot; se at the moment .
but I think , that is a bit too informal .
how about the goldener Adler ?
where is it ?
it is back there near the station .
okay , let us fix that .
what time do you have in mind ?
well , about seven $ P- $ M ,
and then make it a pleasant evening of it .
all right , that suits me too , fine .
fine , I will inform my people then ,
are you bringing your staff ?
yes , I think so ,
as far as the people can fit in ,
I already know about three of them ,
yes , fine , Mrs Hempel ,
let us do it like this
and meet again for the preliminary meeting .
okay ?
bye .
bye .
hello , Mr Weiterscheit .
hello .
is that Weiterscheit speaking ?
yes , it is .
great , Mr Weiterscheit .
I have just taken a look into my diary and found that it is about time we took another trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim together .
well ,
I have been thinking of it , too , recently and I was just about to call you up .
fine ,
and the time that would also fit superbly in the diary is the visit to the $ B $ A $ S $ F we agreed on some time ago .
how about your diary ?
well , it looks as if I am free in January between the seventh and the twelfth .
between the seventh and the twelfth .
do you also have time sometime before and after that ,
so that we could hold a preliminary meeting to prepare for it a bit ,
and perhaps have supper together afterwards , if we could arrange it somehow .
well , I would like to make a proposal .
we could get together on Saturday the seventh and hold that meeting .
and then we could go to that conference on Sunday already .
yes , that certainly is perfect .
then we would be there from the eighth to Thursday , January the twelfth nineteen hundred ninety five .
and we would have the weekend after for a little supper or we could also consider a little drink or something .
that has always been nice .
yes , that has always been nice .
I will be at a conference in Berlin then .
well , how about
afterwards I have already got a very tight schedule
and if we went to the conference a little earlier ,
no , it has already been on since the fourth , if I am informed correctly .
how about an earlier time ?
well , as far as I know , they do not start on the fourth , as Epiphany is on the sixth .
but I have got no time before that anyway , that is between the first and the sixth .
the next time possible for me would be from January the seventeenth to January the twenty fourth .
I have got no more time in January after that ,
then ,
during the first two weeks of February I would have lots of time in any case and also during the last two weeks of February .
so except for February the fifteenth and sixteenth I would be free in February
are you perhaps free then ?
I have got only little time in February , as January is not particularly convenient with me .
I have got to go to the $ Z $ D $ F and also to Cologne and so on .
we have got a meeting there ,
that is making it a bit tight for me .
well , the first two weeks of February , give me a definite time then .
maybe we could meet then .
okay , as for me , we could meet on the first of February , that is this first meeting ,
then we could attend that conference on the following five days and have supper together afterwards ,
thus we would get it all done in one week and would still be contented .
well , from the seventh to the eighth of February I have to attend , willy-nilly , the congress in Munich ,
that does not suit me at all .
that is , I am free on the first six days of February ,
we could hold our preliminary meeting then ,
go to Mannheim for five days right after it
and perhaps fix our joint supper for some time between the ninth and the sixteenth .
maybe at a weekend ,
as we should even have a day free afterwards ,
in case we had one too many .
and celebrate .
if it is a success , we will definitely have something to celebrate ,
then I would just say , we hold the preliminary meeting on Wednesday , the first .
say at the Sheraton Hotel at Frankfurt airport , which is not that far from Mannheim ,
and we could meet on Saturday ,
February the eleventh to have supper together afterwards , maybe at your or my place , we will see about that later .
yes , that does sound good .
okay , let us fix that then and let us keep in touch .
right , well , see you .
bye .
bye .
Thyssen-Schulte . Walter speaking .
hello .
hello .
this is Breuler speaking .
I am calling about that conference in Ludwigshafen ,
no , in Mannheim .
sorry .
the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference .
in fact we planned to go there together for five days .
we still have to fix a time either for January or February now .
when would it suit you ?
well , first I have got to check whether I am responsible for that at all .
just let me find out .
yes , I have just found a note here ,
yes , that is no problem , fine .
it does not seem to matter much when we go there .
as it seems to take quite a long time I suggest we go there shortly after new years day perhaps .
that is in the second week of January to escape the Christmas frustration a little .
to be honest , I would prefer the week from the sixteenth to the twentieth ,
as we still have to prepare the meeting .
and then ,
we could perhaps attend the conference in the week from Tuesday seventeenth to Saturday twenty first .
well , that is very inconvenient for me unfortunately , as I am completely booked up on Wednesday eighteenth and also on Thursday
which is why an earlier date would suit me better .
if I may tell you briefly here on the phone ,
I am free from Monday , January second to Tuesday , the seventeenth inclusive ,
maybe we could try to combine these times .
after that it would be tight for me again , if we did it all in one go ,
then the next time possible would be the first two weeks of February for example .
so ,
if we met on Saturday , the seventh ,
to prepare the matter ,
we could go from Sunday the eighth to Thursday the twelfth .
that is a good thing .
let us simply arrange it so ,
that we meet then and somehow discuss further details at an earlier preliminary meeting .
I do not think we need any companions or do you have any particular experts , who are expected to give a talk ?
no , not to my knowledge ,
for example on Wednesday , the eleventh .
yes .
that is a very good proposal .
yes . fine .
and afterwards we could meet for supper to talk the thing over again .
Friday , the twentieth ?
yes , sure .
that would be right after it ,
and so it really would not be worthwhile starting something else anyway .
fine , all right .
see you .
thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello Mr Breuler ,
R &quot; ubenschmidt speaking ,
we agreed to go on a trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim sometime ago .
I think we should make a more detailed arrangement now .
hello , Mr R &quot; ubenschmidt .
I agree .
I have already got a lot of appointments in January ,
so , that is going to be a bit more difficult for me , I think ,
especially , if we want to hold a preliminary meeting before .
it would be possible from the seventeenth to the twenty fourth , for example .
January , you mean ?
in January , right .
well , that is bad ,
on Wednesday and Thursday , eighteenth , nineteenth I have got an appointment ,
I would rather have more free successive days in February .
what do you think of February from the ninth to the sixteenth ?
nineteenth to sixteenth ,
nineteenth to fourteenth are six days , I think ,
yes , we could meet from the nineteenth to the thirteenth , for example ,
that would be a good time .
the ninth to the thirteenth ?
ninth to twelfth ,
sorry .
that is four days .
one , two , three , four ,
ninth to thirteenth , right .
yes , that would suit me fine , too .
only the preliminary meeting , well , we could hold that at the beginning of February .
what do you think of that ?
yes , that would be a good idea ,
I have always got time then .
that would not be a problem .
so ,
we could perhaps hold the preliminary meeting on Friday ,
February third and then we take the five day trip from the ninth to the thirteenth .
we could also have supper together right on the fourteenth , could not we ?
yes , it would be nice to have a little supper after this trip .
that would suit me too .
okay , fine , everything is fixed then .
goodbye , if there are not any further problems .
no , no more problems ,
goodbye , Mr Breuler .
good evening , Mr Schmidt .
good evening , Mr Schleicher ,
how are you ?
quite fine , and you ?
yes , me too ,
what do you want at such a late hour ?
I have got a request ,
in fact I would like to invite you on a five day trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim with a subsequent visit to $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen .
oh , to what do I owe the honour ?
I have always liked you .
as you do know .
oh , that is really kind .
when would it suit you ?
well the first two weeks of February would suit me fine .
actually , I wanted to hold a preliminary meeting before that ,
maybe we should plan that before we plan the five day trip .
that is just how I see it .
how about the second week of January ?
within the working week ?
yes , for example on Tuesday the tenth .
yes , that would suit me fine .
I would like to invite you to my house .
we will cook then and we could discuss it in our own time , unhurriedly .
and what about the trip ?
when are you free for several successive days ?
should we first say , the Tuesday , at my house at eight $ P- $ M ?
yes . excellent .
how do you feel about the time from January eighteenth onwards ?
Wednesday ?
on the eighteenth , I have got a visit to the $ Z $ D $ F in Mainz ,
but what about Friday , the twentieth , over the weekend ?
that fits perfectly ,
I have already got an appointment with the $ F $ A $ Z the Wednesday after , but I am free before that .
yes , that is excellent .
so , from when on ?
from Friday the twentieth to Tuesday the twenty fourth .
yes , exactly .
fine ,
let us meet at the station .
right .
well , the train leaves at thirty five minutes past ten in the morning ,
I would say , we meet at ten o &apos;clock ,
maybe we could go for a cup of coffee .
oh , yes , there is this little cosy cafe just round the corner .
and when shall we have the supper afterwards ?
some time at the beginning of February would suit me best .
yes , that is all very fine with me .
in fact , if you do not mind , maybe on Friday , February third ?
yes , we could stay out late then , as there is the weekend afterwards .
right , we have got to take advantage of it right away , have not we ?
exactly .
yes , fine , let us say Friday at eight in the evening ,
oh yes , that is were they serve that wonderful lobster .
right .
they also have that very delicious champagne there ,
and I think the whole trip is probably going to be wonderful .
yes , I think so , too .
so , thank you very much for your call ,
and we will meet on Tuesday , January tenth .
fine ,
I am looking forward to it ,
bye .
bye .
hello , Ms Steffes speaking .
I am calling you because of the five day trip to Mannheim we still have to settle upon ,
the one with the visit to Ludwigshafen at the end .
oh , yes , I already heard about that ,
my name is Stober ,
I do not know if you were already informed of this .
well , I think there was a preparatory meeting planned that was to take place first , is that right ?
yes ,
the preparatory meeting , maybe we could arrange it for January already , whereas for the conference February might be better .
because in January , we are on holiday until the sixth ,
then I will be at a congress in Berlin from the thirteenth to the sixteenth ,
and on the twenty fifth of January there is a press conference in Frankfurt ,
this is why I am quite busy in January ,
the preparatory meeting is all I could do then .
well ,
I will not be as busy in January as in February but I think I could squeeze it in February .
but I would prefer to do the preparatory meeting before the eighteenth .
this means between the end of the holidays and the middle of January .
yes , sure .
I would be free all the time between the ninth and the twelfth inclusive .
how about Tuesday evening then ?
fine , maybe at about seven o &apos;clock .
and where shall we meet ?
which place would suit you ?
I do not know if it is the same with you but I tend to be hungry at that time ,
we could combine the meeting with having dinner .
yes , that would be fine .
shall we meet at the Maxim Hotel in K &quot; onigsstra &quot; se then ?
would that be okay for you ?
yes , that should not be a problem for me .
let us fix that ,
we will meet there at seven o &apos;clock on Thursday the tenth to do the preparatory discussion .
fine , and regarding the conference now .
when would you be free in February for five days ?
well , from the first to the fifth of February would not be bad with me actually .
and maybe , yes , that would be as good .
between the ninth and the fifteenth of February .
after that , my time is very limited .
I would have to make cuts in my other plans then .
well , the days between the first and the fifth would suit me fine .
later on , I have another conference ,
it would be nice if we could go to Mannheim and Ludwigshafen from the first to the fifth then .
fine , I would say , we could put that down in our diaries then .
and it would not be a problem to change it by then if any problems occurred .
yes , that is fine .
I am going to tell my secretary to see to the flights , etcetera , and to accommodation .
yes , and now about a posterior discussion ,
maybe we could go out for dinner again once during the weeks after the conference to talk about it .
yes , maybe it would be good not to let pass too much time .
I will be on a congress in Munich from the seventh to the eighth but I would prefer to meet at the weekend directly afterwards .
during the time between the tenth and the twelfth .
would seven o &apos;clock be okay again ?
I would prefer to meet earlier , actually , because I already have tickets for a concert that evening .
yes , sure , we could also make an appointment for lunch .
would you prefer that ?
yes , I would really prefer that .
otherwise we should have to switch to Saturday .
no , let us better meet on Friday at midday then .
I would like to keep the weekend free .
when and where do you think we should meet ?
well ,
I would say that we should meet at two o &apos;clock , maybe at the same place we fixed for the preparatory meeting .
you seem to have dined out there a couple of times already and I trust you completely that this is quite a good restaurant .
oh , yes , I have been really satisfied with them .
fine , Ms Stober , see you on Tuesday the tenth then .
should anything unexpected happen I will call you .
all right then , goodbye .
yes , thank you for calling , Ms Steffes ,
see you on Tuesday then , goodbye .
hello , this is Schmitz speaking .
I hope this is correct , am I speaking to Ms Meyer ?
I would like to ask you something ,
I would like to make an appointment with you for a five day trip to the $ D $ G $ S $ F conference in Mannheim , including a visit to BASF in Ludwigshafen .
fine .
I would propose to also arrange a preparatory meeting beforehand .
Sunday , the eighth of January would suit me fine .
and the following five days , from Monday to Friday ,
for the trip and the visit to Ludwigshafen ,
if that suits you .
no , I am afraid I will not be free that weekend , beginning on Friday the thirteenth .
maybe we could hold the preparatory meeting a week earlier
and do the trip a bit later ,
we could fix Sunday the eighth for the preparatory meeting then and plan the trip from Tuesday the seventeenth on .
yes , we can fix the eighth for the preparatory meeting
it will not be possible before Friday then .
well , from Friday the twentieth to Tuesday the twenty fourth would also be possible for me .
fine , that is all right with me as well ,
and maybe Wednesday the twenty fifth for a concluding dinner together .
no , I am sorry , but there is a press conference on that day at the $ F $ A $ Z in Frankfurt ,
that will not be possible .
maybe we could have dinner two or three days later ,
on Thursday the twenty sixth or Friday the twenty seventh , if possible .
yes , Friday the twenty seventh would be fine with me .
I am not free on the twenty sixth ,
I have a meeting in Cologne then .
but the twenty seventh would be okay .
fine , dinner on the twenty seventh then , I would say , well , seven o &apos;clock would suit me fine .
I would like to do the preparatory meeting on Sunday the eighth at two o &apos;clock if that is all right with you .
Sunday at two , and dinner at seven , yes , that is fine .
thank you very much .
that was really easy .
see you on Sunday the eighth of January then .
see you then , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , Mr Meyer , this is M &quot; uller speaking again .
I would like to talk about a five day trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim with you ,
with a subsequent visit to $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen ,
and we also have to arrange a preparatory meeting to be held beforehand .
and if you do not mind , we could have dinner together at the end of the conference , how do you feel about that ?
oh , yes , I also wanted to talk with you about that .
how about Saturday the seventh of January for the preparatory meeting ?
yes , I am free then .
we could fix that .
and when ?
all right , shall we meet at my place ?
no doubt you can cook but let us better go to a restaurant .
well , all right . and which one ?
the Chinese restaurant next to your place .
but their cookery is much worse than mine .
but okay , let us do that then .
all right . we will meet there at eight o &apos;clock .
and when shall we fix a time for the trip itself ?
yes , the trip , I think we have just gone wrong ,
we just planned a dinner , is that right ? or was it the preparatory meeting ?
I think that does not matter , we can do it like this ,
now , I would focus on the trip itself first .
okay , how about Monday the ninth ?
wait . one ,
two , three ,
four , five ,
well ,
that will be somewhat difficult .
I am not free on that Friday .
how about Tuesday the seventeenth then ?
that is not so good because I have an appointment at $ Z $ D $ F on the eighteenth
and this is really a very important appointment which I cannot postpone .
how about Friday the twentieth ?
that would be possible .
I have time exactly until Tuesday the twenty fourth ,
all right , we could do that at the weekend and the days after ,
and on Tuesday we could have dinner together again , could not we ?
perfect .
I note that .
thank you very much .
fine , see you then .
goodbye .
bye .
this is Peter Beham speaking .
would you like to spell that ?
I spell , it is $ P $ E $ T $ E $ R $ B $ E $ H $ A $ M .
that is $ B $ A $ R $ B $ A $ R $ A $ W $ E $ S $ E $ N $ I $ C $ K .
I am planning a business trip to Bonn , on a Saturday in March .
I would like to know if we could make an appointment then .
yes , we have to fix the five day trip some day .
I would have time in the middle of February , for example from the fifteenth on .
oh , wait , no , I just noticed I already have an appointment then
but it would be possible from the eighteenth on .
that is not so good ,
I have to go to Cologne from the nineteenth to the twenty third .
for me , it would be better between Tuesday the ninth and Sunday the fourteenth , some time around that time .
in February as well ?
in February as well .
I do not have time then , there already is an appointment ,
but I am free later in February , after the twenty fifth .
after the twenty fifth would be fine with me as well ,
it is only , well , I am just thinking about it .
yes , after the twenty fifth would be fine .
fine , we could do the trip ,
well , I will be coming back on the twenty fourth ,
I would therefore prefer to begin at the twenty sixth of February .
from February the twenty sixth to March the second .
would that be possible ?
that would be really good .
that would suit me fine .
we will fix that then .
we should also agree on a time for having dinner in March on a Saturday .
would March the thirteenth be possible ?
March the thirteenth is difficult with me ,
I already have an appointment on that day .
March the twentieth would be fine .
we agree on March the twentieth then .
I have noted that .
we should also include two preparatory meetings for our business trip to Bonn , right in the first week ,
right this week .
when would it suit you ?
tomorrow would not be bad actually .
how do you feel about that ?
I will be free the whole day .
fine , let us do it tomorrow then .
what time would suit you ?
well , any time would be fine .
do you have any appointments before or are you free as well ?
I am free .
it would suit me , well , maybe after lunch .
round about two o &apos;clock ?
yes , that is fine .
at two o &apos;clock .
fine , two o &apos;clock .
I note that .
and we need one more appointment .
one more appointment before the trip ?
well , maybe the middle of February would not be bad .
what do you think ?
but I would only have time between February the fourth and the eighth and between the fifteenth and the twenty second or twenty third .
well , I am quite busy during that time .
how about February the fourth ?
yes , that is fine .
but on that day I am never free before two o &apos;clock .
that would be problematic then as I only have time until three o &apos;clock on that Thursday .
would that be possible with you ?
I would be free on the first of February .
I would be free from nine to eleven or from two to six o &apos;clock on that day .
yes , it suits me between nine and eleven .
let us make an appointment for nine o &apos;clock then .
fine , Monday , February the first , from nine to eleven .
well , hello , what is your name , please ?
well , my name is Susanne Hillmeyer .
how do you spell that ?
with double $ L . $ H $ I double $ L $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
and what is your name ?
my name is Esther Schmidt .
is that Schmidt with a $ D and a $ T ?
right , that is $ S $ C $ H $ M $ I $ D $ T .
all right .
we have to fix a time for a five day business trip to Cologne now .
could you tell me when it suits you best ?
my suggestion would be either at the end of May or any time between the fourteenth and the twenty second of June .
between the fourteenth and the twenty second is not so good .
at the end of May it would be best ,
between May the twentieth and the twenty sixth .
I am afraid that will not be possible with me as I have an appointment in the evening on May the twenty fifth .
how about from May the eighteenth to , wait , that is one ,
two , three ,
four , five ,
from May the eighteenth to the twenty second ?
that would be fine .
from the eighteenth to the twenty second of May .
all right , we could do that .
fine , and now we have to fix a time for having dinner , some time in June on a Saturday .
when do you have time ?
on virtually every Saturday except for the eighth and the twenty ninth .
wait , that is June .
the eighth actually is a Tuesday in June .
oh , excuse me , that was the wrong month .
well , I will be occupied on June the fifth and the twenty sixth .
any other Saturday would be fine .
wait , you said you will be busy on the twenty sixth and on the fifth ?
wait ,
that will be problematic now because I have an appointment on the nineteenth of June and on the twelfth as well .
what shall we do then ?
that is really bad .
what are your plans for the fifth ?
well , I will also be busy on the fifth .
will that only be in the evening or the whole
it is , are you busy in the evening or only in the morning or do not you know that exactly ?
I marked the whole day .
probably , it will not be possible on that day .
and how about the twelfth ?
you do not have time then , you said .
and on the nineteenth ?
on the nineteenth I am occupied from seven to ten o &apos;clock in the evening ,
it seems that we will have to have dinner some day at noon .
why not ?
we will go out for lunch then .
that is not a problem .
and when ?
maybe round about noon .
all right , that is fine .
we will meet on the nineteenth at noon then .
fine .
I also need an appointment for preparing the trip during the first week of April .
I would have time on Thursday ,
today I would not , and on April the third , that is Saturday , I will not be free either .
my suggestion would be Monday , April the fifth or maybe Sunday , April the fourth ?
let us say Monday , April the fifth .
what time suits you best ?
wait , are you free in the morning ?
yes , of course , if you prefer that .
well , when then ?
round about nine o &apos;clock ?
we could do that , all right .
at nine in my office then .
fine .
we need one more time then for another preparatory meeting .
it does not matter when .
make a suggestion , maybe again in May .
all right , the first week I will be in Erfurt , so I will not be available .
Mother &apos;s day is not so good as well .
but then we could , right on Thursday , May the sixth ?
or in any case during that week , after May the fifth .
of course , that is not possible with me now .
how about the tenth , Monday , or the eleventh ?
that is not possible with me .
let us have a look at the thirteenth , fourteenth .
I will be free on the fourteenth .
let us fix that right away , Friday the fourteenth , is not it ?
fine .
and at what time ?
perhaps at three o &apos;clock in the afternoon ?
all right , three o &apos;clock in the afternoon .
that is all right ?
let us better meet at your place .
hello , this is Kathrin Schweikl .
I would like to fix a time for our business trip with you .
but I do not know who you are , yet .
hello , this is Zechnall .
could you give me your name first please ?
yes , my name is Schweikl , $ S $ C $ H $ W $ E $ I $ K $ L .
and could you give me your name please ?
well , my name is Zechnall .
you spell it $ Z $ E $ C $ H $ N $ A $ L $ L .
so you are calling because of this five day business trip to Cologne .
right ,
would you have time for it in April ?
wait , I have to find that out .
I would have time at the end of April , from the twenty seventh on , but that would include May day .
it would not be possible with you from the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth then ?
no , I already have another appointment from the twenty fourth to the twenty sixth .
another possibility would be from the fifth to the ninth .
fantastic .
that would be possible with me as well .
let us agree on going to Cologne from the fifth to the ninth of May then .
all right , agreed , I have noted that .
we also need a time for having dinner on a Saturday in June .
when would it suit you ?
I could offer you either the fifth or , a bit later , the nineteenth at noon or else the twenty sixth .
the nineteenth would be fine with me and it is a business dinner anyway .
my suggestion would be in the evening as you will only be free after noon .
no , that was a misunderstanding .
I will not be free from seven to ten o &apos;clock .
all right , let us say around noon then .
when exactly ?
at one o &apos;clock ?
agreed .
I recap : that is on June the nineteenth at one o &apos;clock then .
perfect .
what else have we got ?
a time for preparing the trip , that would have to be within the first week of April .
well , today is the first .
I do not have time on Saturday .
how much time do we need for the preparations ?
oh , I reckon , about four hours .
we could meet tomorrow already , if that suits you ?
well , on Friday , that is tomorrow , April the second , I will not be free before three o &apos;clock .
but three o &apos;clock will be fine .
let us say tomorrow at three o &apos;clock .
fine .
I have put that down .
what else do we need ?
maybe we should fix a time shortly before the trip now , it does not matter when .
I think the trip is going to be some time in May .
I suggest April the thirtieth then .
fine .
that is a good idea .
but again after three o &apos;clock .
on April the thirteenth at three , the thirtieth at three o &apos;clock .
I recap : April the thirtieth at three o &apos;clock .
fine .
fine , goodbye .
hello , my name is Allalouf ,
that is spelled $ A double $ L $ A $ L $ O $ U $ F .
what is your name please ?
my name is von R &quot; omer .
that is $ R $ &quot; O $ M $ E $ R .
that should not be a problem .
well , Ms von R &quot; omer , we wanted to go on a business trip together , for five days .
my suggestion would be ,
it would be fine with me after July the twentieth .
wait , well during that time I have several smaller appointments ,
therefore , five days in a row will not be possible with me then .
I would prefer meeting at the beginning of August then ,
maybe from August the third on .
well , I am afraid I do not have time after August the third ,
I will be gone for a holiday for a week then .
how about from the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth of August ?
I will have the same problem again then , I have got appointments on three of those days .
well , what can we do to solve the problem ?
we will have to do it in September then .
well , my suggestion would be from the first to the fifth of September .
I am afraid it will not be possible with me from the first to the fifth of September as I am going to go to Leipzig from the fourth to the eighth .
maybe , I would be free from the ninth to the seventeenth .
yes , that seems to be fine with me .
I think we could fix that time ,
from the ninth to the seventeenth of September then .
actually , from the ninth to the seventeenth would be too long .
we only need five days .
let us say from the ninth to the thirteenth then .
all right .
and we should also meet beforehand , maybe twice , in order to prepare the trip .
my suggestion would be to meet in September once so that the preparatory work and the trip do not differ to much in time ,
and I would suggest , well , Friday , no , Wednesday , September the eighth .
Wednesday , September the eighth ,
that is my last day in Leipzig .
so that is not so good .
but if we maybe postponed the trip , from the tenth to the fourteenth ,
from Friday the tenth to Tuesday the fourteenth ,
we could meet on Thursday the ninth .
how do you feel about that ?
Thursday would be possible basically .
though I have an appointment all the morning long until half past twelve ,
but I will be free in the afternoon and in the evening .
fine , my suggestion would be to meet at midday , round about one o &apos;clock ?
or half past one ?
maybe that would be better as you have an appointment until half past one ?
yes , half past one is all right .
and for beginning our business trip we agreed on the tenth now .
exactly .
we now need another appointment during the first week .
maybe we could meet even this week .
how do you feel about tomorrow , Friday the second ?
well , on Friday the second , I would have time as well .
that is tomorrow then .
I would suggest to meet for lunch .
excuse me , I just realized that according to my weekly schedule I do not have time on Fridays .
that is not possible with me at all .
actually , it will not be possible with me before Tuesday then .
Tuesday , round about one o &apos;clock .
that is not so good as I have an appointment on Tuesday afternoon that will last until six o &apos;clock .
but if you had time at seven o &apos;clock we could meet then .
fine , seven o &apos;clock then , all right .
now , we also need a time to go out for dinner together .
maybe in August ?
Sunday would be fine with me as I am sometimes occupied on Saturday .
perhaps on Sunday , August the fifteenth ?
that is Assumption day .
how do you feel about that ?
that is not so good .
I am already busy then ,
I will be on holiday with my family then .
all I could do is offer you another day .
the twenty second , a Sunday as well .
no , I am afraid that is not possible with me .
only the first of August would be possible with me then .
that would be as problematic with me as I already have plans for that day .
I hope that you are maybe free on the twenty ninth then .
well , I actually have an appointment on the twenty ninth already .
but I will try to postpone it because I appreciate if we get to know each other personally during a nice dinner before we go on a trip together .
fine , we will do it like this then ,
we will meet on Sunday , August the twenty ninth .
we have fixed all the times then ,
and we will meet for the first time .
when are we going to meet for the first time , this week ?
the first time is on Tuesday at seven o &apos;clock .
fine , we will meet on Tuesday at seven o &apos;clock then .
see you then .
goodbye .
goodbye .
I would like to fix some times with you .
well , what is the matter ?
oh , I am talking about several appointments during the following months .
there is a five day business trip to Kiel ,
we should agree on that first .
when would you have time ?
I am free in July .
I would have virtually no time in July except from the fourteenth on .
that is Wednesday .
but it would have to be over the weekend then .
I see .
I am afraid that is not possible with me .
well , July , my suggestion would be ,
I would have time at the end of August .
how do you feel about that ?
after the twenty fourth ?
no , I have appointments then every two or three days .
that would not be possible ,
we maybe have to take a look at September .
I have a lot of time then ,
the first week would be fine .
Monday the thirteenth would be possible with me , even for five days ,
that would be until Saturday the eighteenth ?
let us fix that right away .
from Monday the thirteenth to Saturday or rather Friday the seventeenth in the evening .
in September , is not it ?
yes .
and on a Sunday in August , I would like to meet you for a business dinner .
August the eighth , the twenty second and the twenty ninth would be possible with me then .
I do not really prefer any of those days as I only have time on the twenty ninth .
let us agree on the twenty ninth .
at what time ?
well , I do not care , actually .
how about eight o &apos;clock in the evening ?
eight o &apos;clock on Sunday , August the twenty ninth , fine .
fine ,
I would suggest to fix a time for preparing the trip now ,
in the first ,
in the next week .
that would be from the first of July to , let us have a look .
what is that ?
no , at the weekend is out of the question .
well , from the first to the eight of July then .
when would you have time during that week ?
I would have time from the first to Monday , July the fifth inclusive .
after that , I will be in Hamburg .
my suggestion would be ,
how about the , yes , today .
do you already have plans for today ?
at two o &apos;clock I have to be at a meeting , but before I am free .
I suggest to meet from twelve to two o &apos;clock then to have a business lunch and to talk about our trip then .
perfect .
but then I do think ,
as the trip is going to be in the middle of September , that we ought to meet again in order to arrange the last preparations for the trip .
would you be free then ?
yes , the trip was from then to then .
how about the last week in August , the week from August the twenty third to the twenty seventh ?
I would be free the whole week except for Monday at midday .
I can only suggest Wednesday the twenty fifth or Friday the twenty seventh .
which day do you prefer ?
Wednesday , but after three o &apos;clock .
I would only have time from three to five o &apos;clock as I am occupied after five o &apos;clock , otherwise it would have to be on Friday .
let us meet on Wednesday from three to five o &apos;clock then .
I think that would be the best .
all right .
could you spell your name for me please ?
yes , that is Lavergne , $ L $ A $ V $ E $ R $ G for George , $ N for Nellie $ E for Edward .
maybe you could spell yours for me as well ?
that is Ms K &quot; uhn , $ K $ U with umlaut , $ H for Harry , $ N for Nellie .
thank you , Ms K &quot; uhn , see you tonight then . we can arrange everything else then .
fine , Ms von Lavergne , goodbye .
goodbye .
my name is Mara , $ M $ A $ R $ A .
and my name is Korn , $ K $ O $ R $ N .
all right , we have to arrange a business trip ,
it will be a five day business trip to Hannover .
well , it would be possible with me at the end of July , after July the twentieth ,
then it would be possible in August ,
from July the twenty fourth to the end and after that in September ,
between the ninth and the seventeenth and between the twentieth and the thirtieth .
I think the business trip is supposed to be five days long .
yes , that is right .
well , it would suit me best at the end of August , I believe .
when would you have time at the end of August ?
from August the twenty fifth on .
would that be all right with you ?
until August the thirtieth ?
August the twenty fifth is on a Sunday , but that does not matter .
yes , that would be fine .
from the twenty fith then .
that is one , two , three , four , five , well , until Thursday the twenty ninth .
until Thursday the twenty ninth .
something is wrong here .
excuse me , I have looked at July .
I have to look at August , all right .
right , the twenty fifth is on a Wednesday .
that would be possible ?
as I have said , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday , Sunday , until the thirty first if you like .
that would be five working days .
we would certainly be able to bring our affairs to a conclusion then .
fine .
we have fixed those five days then in any case .
we now have to fix a time for preparing the trip .
well , we ought to do that at the beginning of the month .
I am not quite sure , maybe you could make a suggestion .
it would be possible with me on July the second already .
that would be tomorrow .
today is the first of July nineteen ninety three .
that would be nice .
all right , I would like to know when it would be possible with you during the week .
on which day and at what time .
July would suit me fine as well , for example on the second ,
that would be Friday ,
Friday , July the second ,
and it does not matter when .
we can meet in the morning or in the afternoon .
as you prefer .
fine , let us do it on Friday then .
we should both take the whole day off ,
we will arrange that somehow .
it is only to plan the whole thing , actually .
fine . I agree to that .
we have got that appointment then .
a time for preparing the trip and another time for preparing the trip .
but the first appointment would have to be during the first week of our monthly schedule .
why do not we combine that with the other appointment and do it on Friday as well ?
that would be my suggestion .
well , we already did that ,
that is what I meant with this appointment .
the appointment on July the second is just what I meant by a preparatory meeting for the trip .
well , we still need a time on a Sunday in August for a business dinner and another time whenever we choose .
all right . August the first is a Sunday but I do not have time then .
how about August the eighth ?
on August the eighth I do not have time .
I would have time on the first or else on Monday , August the sixteenth and then on Sunday the twenty ninth .
on August the twenty ninth then because I do not have time the other Sundays .
all right ?
all right .
we now need any time we choose for preparing the trip .
maybe you could tell me where , when it would suit you .
all right .
I just thought that we could combine that .
well , okay , any time .
my suggestion would be Friday , July the sixteenth .
would that be possible with
Friday , July the sixteenth is not possible with me .
I would be free
I am talking about September now as I am free then a lot of days ,
for example between the ninth and the seventeenth of September .
how do you feel about that ?
it would be possible but I do not think it is really wise as our trip is going to be at the end of August as far as I remember ,
or was it at the beginning of August ?
that is right , our trip will be in August ,
we therefore should , in August , at the end of August ,
from the twenty fifth on , we said .
for five days .
how would you feel about Friday the twentieth or Thursday the nineteenth ?
yes , both .
no problem .
I would be free on Friday and on Thursday .
let us say Friday then .
everything is fine then .
fine , we will meet on Friday at noon then .
is that all right ?
yes , perfect .
my diary is just telling me I always have time on Fridays .
we fixed all the times then .
it was really nice to get to know you .
I have to admit I am looking forward to the trip .
thank you , I am looking forward to it as well .
goodbye .
well , I should introduce myself .
my name is , let us say , Peter M &quot; uller .
that is spelled $ P $ E $ T $ E $ R and M &quot; uller , $ M $ U $ E $ L $ L $ E $ R .
hello , my name is Claudia Fohrer .
Claudia with a $ C and Fohrer is spelled $ F $ O $ H $ R $ E $ R .
fine , do you hear me ?
yes ?
we will arrange the five day business trip to Berlin then .
well , for this business trip to Berlin the time between November the sixth and the eleventh would be fine .
would that suit you ?
oh , I am afraid that will not be possible as we will already be in Leipzig then .
November the twelfth is not possible with me .
I will also be busy from the twelfth to the seventeenth of November .
I would rather suggest the time between the thirteenth and the seventeenth of December then .
yes , that would be fine , that would be all right with me .
that was December , was not it ?
from the thirteenth to the seventeenth of December , right .
we already agreed on the business trip to Berlin then .
the next thing to fix would be a time for a business dinner on a Sunday in November .
November the twenty eighth would suit me fine , that is Advent Sunday .
are you free then ?
yes , all right , that is fine .
and a time for preparing the trip during the first week of your monthly schedule .
my suggestion would be , for example , Friday , October the eighth .
I am afraid that will not be possible with me .
I will not be free before the eighteenth .
or in the week before , that is the week from October the first to the eighth .
well , I think it would have to be after the fourth , would not it ?
because today is the fourth .
today is the fourth of October , is not it ?
well , we could also try the sixth .
yes , the sixth is fine with me as well .
let us agree on October the sixth .
all right , October the sixth .
and the last time , any time we choose for preparing the trip .
well , my suggestion would be the twenty first of November , Memorial day .
yes , that would even be fine with me as well .
we will do that then .
all right , that is it then , is not it ?
goodbye .
hello .
I would like to arrange a business trip with you .
we have to go to Frankfurt together .
I should introduce myself first , I am Ms Renner .
that is spelled $ R $ E $ N $ N $ E $ R .
hello , this is Kroner speaking .
I was already told about you .
we can fix the times right away .
but to be sure , I spell you my name so that you are able to remember it , that is Kroner ,
$ K $ R $ O $ N $ E $ R .
please make a suggestion as to the times .
all right , our business trip to Frankfurt .
I have to have a look when in which month , it suits me best .
yes , how about the last week in November ?
well , that would be somewhat problematic as I will be on a two day business trip to Schwerin on Thursday and Friday .
Monday would be fine .
Monday the twenty ninth .
that would be the end of November and the beginning of December .
Monday the twenty ninth ,
Tuesday the thirtieth ,
Wednesday the first ,
Thursday the second and Friday the third .
that would be a possibility .
that should be possible with me as well .
from Monday , November the twenty ninth to Friday , December the third .
right , that is it .
I think that would be fine .
fine , we have got that then .
we can fix a time for a business dinner then , on a Sunday in November .
well , that is a bit difficult .
the twenty eighth , that is Advent Sunday , is not possible .
for I am a very active member of my parish .
the twenty first is Memorial day , that is not possible either .
oh , that would be difficult as I will be in Leipzig the whole week , from Saturday to Thursday .
there is only the fourteenth left then .
unfortunately , I will be gone the whole week then , from the twelfth to the seventeenth .
what we could do
we could meet on October the thirty first , that is a Sunday as well .
no , it really should , it is an important business dinner , it should be in November .
well ,
maybe we could actually do it on the Memorial day because you maybe could do your duties during the day .
yes , on Memorial day we could meet for dinner .
that would be possible , yes .
on Advent Sunday it is impossible as I will be busy all day long .
I also have to be with the family then .
but on Memorial day ,
yes ,
I would be free after midday , we therefore could meet for dinner .
fine , let us agree on this Sunday , November the twenty first .
at six o &apos;clock ?
and I will tell the others .
agreed , all right .
fine , I think it is quite important to also fix a time for preparing the trip already ,
and I think we should do it right this week .
how do you feel about that ?
well , basically , I agree .
I only have to have a look .
how long was the trip going to be ?
the trip is supposed to take five days , we have just fixed that , have not we ?
it was going to be from November the twenty ninth to December the third , was not it ?
all right .
yes , that is it exactly , that is the trip .
yes , the preparatory meeting .
how do you feel about Wednesday the twenty fourth ?
well , today is Monday , October the fourth ,
agreed .
though I was thinking of November , but it is probably the best to do it as quickly as possible .
well , make a suggestion .
all right .
well , today is Monday .
I would have time on Tuesday between nine o &apos;clock in the morning and two o &apos;clock in the afternoon , for example .
I will be very busy from nine to ten on Tuesday .
that is not possible then ,
but we could meet for lunch .
at one o &apos;clock .
fine .
let us meet on Tuesday , October the fifth at one o &apos;clock then .
perfect , yes .
fine .
but I fear that one day might not be enough for the whole trip .
let us fix another time .
it does not matter when .
some time before the trip .
please make a suggestion .
well , my suggestion would be November .
maybe on the eighteenth or nineteenth .
fine , thank you , goodbye .
on November the eighteenth , that is Thursday , it is difficult with me .
I will be busy from nine to two o &apos;clock then
and I just realize that I have another appointment at half past two ,
that would be really difficult .
I have another proposal to make ,
how about the week after ?
Monday , November the twenty second , some time before two o &apos;clock .
did I get you right , Monday the twenty second ?
exactly .
I would be free on Monday the twenty second from ten on .
that would be fine .
perfect .
yes , that would be all right .
well , I think we have got that then and are able to leisurely plan our trip .
fine , thank you very much .
thanks to you .
I think that the place and the restaurants where we will meet do not have to be discussed .
maybe you should note my name .
do you have a pen to write it down ?
that is , my name is B &quot; oer , $ B $ &quot; O $ E $ R .
fine .
well , as to the five day business trip to Frankfurt , have you already thought of a time ?
when would it suit you best ?
maybe I should also introduce myself .
my name is Lerch , $ L $ E $ R $ C $ H .
and it would suit me best in November , after the twenty second .
well , after the twenty second is not possible with me at all , I have just realized ,
I will be busy for two days then with other tasks .
how do you feel about the beginning of November ?
the weekend would have to be included but we could take Friday , Saturday , Sunday , Monday , Tuesday ,
I would be free then ,
or we could do it at the end of October if that is not too soon for you .
that would be from the twenty fifth to the twenty ninth .
that would be really fine with me .
after the sixth .
well , I am afraid the first time is not possible with me .
we could talk about a time in December .
what did you say , from when to when would you have time ?
the week after the sixth .
that would be the sixth , seventh , eighth , ninth and tenth then .
well ,
Friday would be somewhat difficult but maybe I could be back in the morning already to have the afternoon free for another appointment .
would this time in December be all right with you ?
yes .
fine , let us do the business trip then ,
let us begin on Monday the sixth and see to it to be back by Friday at midday .
we will fix that now , all right ?
fine .
let us fix the next time then , for the business dinner .
my suggestion would be either the twenty eighth , that is Advent Sunday , or the Sunday before .
that is completely up to you now .
I am free on both days .
Sunday the twenty first is as fine with me as the twenty eighth .
just choose a time .
both of them are really fine with me .
my suggestion would be the twenty first then .
all right , let us stick to the twenty first .
let us fix that as well .
fine ,
as to the trip in December we should also think about making an appointment for preparing it .
I have to have a look at my schedule .
I would suggest to do it on December the first .
that is Wednesday , maybe in the afternoon .
how do you feel about that ?
in the afternoon would be difficult with me as I have appointments from two to seven o &apos;clock ,
it would have to be either before or after that .
well , I will be busy all the morning on Wednesday .
on Thursday , I do not have any appointment yet .
we could do it then .
that would be Thursday , December the second .
and it would be in time for the trip .
yes , that is fine with me .
Thursday is fine and the second itself as well .
I would propose to meet somewhere round about four o &apos;clock .
yes , four o &apos;clock is fine with me .
we will fix that , four o &apos;clock .
we will do it then .
but maybe we ought to ,
as we still have some time between the second of December to the actual trip to Frankfurt we should maybe meet again shortly before .
I do not know if one meeting will be enough .
could you suggest another time ?
yes , either on Saturday , that would be fine with me , or on Friday ,
I will be free all day long then .
as you prefer .
are you talking about Friday , December the third now ?
I have to admit that I will have a short appointment in the morning then ,
but it would be possible for me after ten o &apos;clock on Friday the third .
let us fix that then .
I would suggest to meet on Friday the third at noon in order that you have enough time .
yes , all right .
fine , we agreed on all our appointments then .
thank you .
thank you for calling , too .
hello , this is Ploss speaking , $ P $ L $ O double $ S ,
and we wanted to arrange this five day business trip .
hello , my name is Gayst ,
well , what shall we do then ?
I think , well , January would suit me best for this business trip .
and my suggestion would be the week , well ,
maybe the week from the eighteenth to the twenty second .
would that suit you ?
no , I will not have time then as I will already be in L &quot; ubeck .
how about from the sixth , from Wednesday on ?
Wednesday the sixth .
but it is supposed to be a five day ,
and that would be fine I have just realized , yes .
it would really be fine with me from the sixth to the tenth of January .
let us fix that then , from Wednesday , January the sixth to Sunday the tenth .
yes , that is really fine with me as well .
we now have to make another appointment , for a business dinner on a Saturday in March .
what would you suggest ?
my suggestion would be the first Saturday in March already ,
that is the sixth of March .
that is really fine with me again , no , wait .
is not it possible ?
maybe the thirteenth then ?
the sixth of March is fine with me .
we will take that day .
good
we also have to prepare the trip .
we have to find out now how to squeeze that in in our diaries .
my suggestion would be Tuesday morning .
what day would that be , please ?
right in that week beginning on the fifth , tomorrow .
tomorrow then .
yes , we will do that , we will take that day .
let us agree on Monday , January the fifth then , all right .
yes , and we really should do that as we want to leave on the sixth already .
that is right , otherwise it would not be possible .
well , and we should have another time to prepare this trip ,
but I do not think we can make that .
that is what I think as well .
let me think now .
well , maybe we could do it this afternoon still if that suits you .
it would be possible as well , but only from two to six in the afternoon .
that would be fine with me as well .
let us agree on the time from two to six .
I consider that to be too long .
I think two hours will be enough , from three to five .
I think we will decide on how much time we need during the meeting .
yes , all right .
we will stick to that time then .
fine , thank you very much .
see you later .
all right , goodbye .
hello Silke ,
I wanted to fix a time with you for a five day business trip to Stuttgart .
when would you have time ?
February would suit me fine , for example .
I do not know how
hello , I do not understand you any more because you already turned it off .
you seem to have touched the button .
now , I did not understand you .
well , February would suit me fine , from the eighth to the twelfth of February .
that will not be possible with me .
from the fifteenth to the twentieth would be possible with me .
fifteen , twentieth of February , well , that is not possible with me at all .
January then , if you wish , at the end of January .
I am telling you now what is impossible with me in January , the sixth to the eighth is not possible ,
well , actually , that is all impossible .
in January , I would only have time in the time between the twentieth and the twenty eighth .
that is when we could fit in these five days somehow .
or at the end of January , from the thirtieth until February .
that would be possible as well .
no , that is not possible with me ,
the times are just not right , they do not coincide .
probably , it will not be possible with me before March as I think that we can not find a time in January and February .
all right , in March it would be possible with me .
it suits me any time from Ash Wednesday , February the twenty fourth to Thursday the eleventh .
or else from the fifteenth to the twentieth , or after the twenty fourth of March .
March the twenty fourth is not possible but how do you feel about the time from the eighth to the twenty sixth ?
no , that is not possible , wait ,
from the eighth to the fifteenth , during that time ?
or in the time from the seventeenth to the twenty sixth ?
from the seventeenth to the twenty sixth is not possible .
I have an appointment on the twenty third , an appointment on the twenty first .
I am getting the impression that we can not come together .
at the end of March it is impossible with you ?
nothing will be possible after the twenty fourth ?
I have another appointment on the twenty seventh , therefore it will not be possible .
how about February , between February the twenty fifth and March the third ?
perfect .
between February the twenty fifth and March the third we could do it .
oh , or , well , fix a time .
for example , from the twenty fifth to the first .
yes , fine . all right .
we need a time for a business dinner on a Saturday in March .
when would you have time ?
I would be free on the thirteenth and on the twentieth .
the twentieth .
I am free on the twentieth as well .
let us agree on the twentieth , all right ?
yes , all right .
and then , we need a time for preparing the trip within the first week of my monthly schedule .
all right .
well ,
that means during the week from the first to the eighth of January ,
if I get that right , is not it ?
I would have time then , oh no ,
today is the fourth ?
that means from the fourth to the twelfth or from the fourth to the eleventh .
I would actually have time today ,
do I have an appointment today ?
well , as far as I am concerned , for example today between two and six o &apos;clock ?
that is not possible with me , I will be busy today from two to six or seven o &apos;clock .
how about Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday afternoon ?
Friday would also be possible .
Tuesday is fine with me .
Tuesday , whenever it suits you .
my suggestion would be Tuesday at ten , from ten to twelve .
would that be all right ?
that is all right , fine .
and another time for preparing the trip .
when could we fix it ?
maybe still in January as well ?
Tuesday , Wednesday and Friday are completely free or Monday morning or Thursday afternoon .
well , I never have appointments on Tuesdays either .
or , as to me , we could also take Thursday morning .
let us simply agree on Tuesday the twenty sixth .
would that be fine with you ?
Tuesday the twenty sixth will not be possible .
how about Tuesday the nineteenth or Wednesday the twenty seventh ?
yes , if you like , Wednesday the twenty seventh , but in the morning then .
fine , agreed .
we should actually spell our names ,
my name is W &quot; ubbena .
that is William , $ U umlaut , Benjamin , Benjamin , Edward , Nellie , Andrew .
and my name is Eberle .
well , I actually do not know this nice alphabet , but it is $ E $ B $ E $ R $ L $ E .
hello , this is HansTillmann speaking and I would like to speak to Mr Schiel .
hello , my name is Schiel .
that is spelled $ S $ C $ H $ I $ E $ L .
thank you .
my name is spelled $ T $ I $ L $ L $ M $ A $ N $ N .
I am calling you to arrange a business trip in the period of time between January and March nineteen ninety four .
if this business trip is to take place in January still , I could only squeeze it in after the twenty first , Thursday the twenty first .
well ,
I would be free on Thursday but after that ,
on Friday ,
Saturday , Sunday ,
Monday and Tuesday ,
I will be busy .
in January , the only time to do a five day business trip would be after the thirteenth of January , actually ,
Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday and Sunday , or a bit later .
on condition that I may arrive in the late afternoon or in the early evening I would have time that week .
on that condition I could come on the thirteenth
and we had to settle to meet until Sunday .
yes , that would be fine with me .
I would have time from Wednesday to Sunday .
I will arrive in Stuttgart in the late afternoon then .
fine .
I will be expecting you in Stuttgart on Wednesday the tenth in the late afternoon .
thank you very much .
Mr Tillmann , we also need a time on a Saturday in March to meet for lunch or dinner .
well , the sixth and the twenty seventh would suit me fine .
oh , that is too bad .
of all the Saturdays , I do not have time on the sixth and the twenty seventh .
what else do we have ?
there is the twentieth and the thirteenth .
would you have time then ?
I am afraid I do not have time on the thirteenth ,
but , of course , I would be free on the twentieth ,
the beginning of spring .
that is really fine .
well , let us agree on meeting on the twentieth , Saturday the twentieth round about noon .
yes , agreed .
my suggestion would be half past one .
all right , half past one .
thank you .
I put that down .
thank you .
goodbye .
hello , this is Eisen speaking .
that is simply spelled $ E $ I $ S $ E $ N ,
and what is your name ?
my name is Mooshammer ,
that is $ M double $ O $ S $ H $ A double $ M $ E $ R .
I heard that we are supposed to arrange some appointments ,
first and foremost for a five day business trip to Bonn .
when would it suit you best ?
well , we could do it in January still .
that would be Wednesday ,
and then maybe five days including the weekend ?
would that be possible with you ?
no , I am afraid I already have plans for that time .
I will not be free before January the twenty seventh .
that is Wednesday as well .
well , that will be problematic with me .
maybe we should meet a bit later ,
for example at the end of January , from the thirtieth , that is a Saturday , to the beginning of February .
how do you feel about that ?
I am sorry I do not have time then ,
but it would be possible from the fourth of February to the eighth .
well , that is really bad with me now .
but I would have time on February the eighth ,
the week from Monday the eighth until the weekend , the whole week .
how about that then ?
that is not possible with me again .
I will not be free before Thursday the eighteenth .
well , that is not so good .
you see , I am really fond of Shrovetide and I will therefore be gone the whole week beginning on Monday before Lent .
how would it suit you after Ash Wednesday ?
that would suit me really fine .
from February the twenty fifth to March the first .
yes , that is perfect .
we will do that then , will not we ?
the twenty fifth , that is Thursday , Friday , Saturday , Sunday , Monday inclusive .
wonderful , thank you very much .
yes , we now need another time on a Saturday in March for a business dinner .
March the thirteenth would suit me fine .
well , I can tell you when I would have time .
that would be either the sixth or the twentieth or the twenty seventh .
I will only be available on the twentieth even though it is the beginning of spring .
let us stick to this day then .
yes , I would also suggest that .
and that is a nice day .
fine , and then we need a time for preparing our trip to Bonn ,
and it would have to be quite soon , sometime in January .
when in January will not you be free at all so that we can find a time ?
it would be best during the week .
well , I will be off on the eleventh and the twelfth and from the twenty second to the twenty sixth .
and I have some regular appointments , on Monday afternoon and on Thursday morning .
that means that you would have time on Tuesdays ?
yes , that would suit me .
well , how about Tuesday , January the fifth then ?
that would be tomorrow already .
yes , let us get that straight .
that suits me fine .
we will meet tomorrow then .
and when ?
what shall we say ?
maybe at nine o &apos;clock in the morning already ?
I would prefer some time later ,
maybe at eleven o &apos;clock .
fine , tomorrow at eleven o &apos;clock .
that is all right .
we now need another time for preparing the trip .
before the trip as well .
maybe in February .
well , that is the week of Shrovetide for me .
that is difficult as I will be in Cologne then .
but Friday would be all right , for example on the twelfth or on Friday the twenty sixth ?
Friday the twenty sixth would be fine with me .
let us stick to that one .
fine , is that all right with you then ?
yes , Friday , February the twenty sixth is wonderful .
round about eleven o &apos;clock again ?
shall we agree on that ?
yes , eleven is always fine .
fine , I am looking forward to seeing you again tomorrow .
see you then , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , this is Pillau speaking ,
$ P $ I $ L $ L $ A $ U , in order that you can write it down .
got it ?
yes , thank you .
well , you are having the pleasure of talking to Ms Oppermann .
I spell : $ O $ P $ P $ E $ R $ M $ A $ N .
once again , more slowly , $ O $ P $ P $ E $ R $ M $ A $ N , Oppermann .
Oppermann .
thank you very much .
well , my company would like to make a business deal with you and I was told to contact you to meet you in Cologne .
when would you have time ?
well , in what month ?
there is a period of time from July to September that would be possible .
well , the deal actually ought to be made by the end of September .
it does not really matter when we are meeting until then .
all right , earlier would be better .
but I would have more time in September .
I hope that we can come to terms then .
well , the beginning of September would suit me really fine as I will have virtually no appointment except for Thursday evening .
no , I have an appointment on Thursday morning .
are you talking about the first week ?
actually , that is not possible with me at all .
that is , we do need five days in a row .
I just realize that only the second week in September would be possible , actually .
I will not be free before September the tenth .
that is Friday .
perfect .
from Friday the tenth on .
well , a weekend would be included .
we would have to look .
well , why not ?
with me , it would actually be possible to include the weekend .
it will not actually be problematic with me either .
well , according to my diary that would be from the tenth to the fifteenth .
according to mine as well .
the fifteenth is Wednesday .
that is right , yes .
suits me fine , no problem .
fine , we will meet in Cologne on the tenth then .
there is another time I would like to fix with you and that is ,
it would suit me best on a Sunday in August , for a business dinner .
when would it suit you ?
is there anything possible ?
yes , I would have time on the first and on the twenty ninth of August .
it would have to be the twenty ninth then as I will be busy on the first .
I will be off then .
twenty ninth at eight , yes .
fine , that suits me really well .
where shall we meet ?
I would suggest the Mifune in Oberf &quot; ohringer Stra &quot; se .
all right , I do not know it yet but I will have a look at the city map and then it should not be problematic .
just enter a taxi and tell the driver .
he ought to know .
if it is that well known , fine .
and as to the trip , we also have to fix a time for preparing it because of the papers we are going to need ..
right , we should settle that .
well , that would have to be before September the tenth then .
August is not so good except for the last week when we already planned to have our business dinner ,
and in July it would be better at the end of the month as well .
when would it suit you ?
well , I would like to have concluded the preparations for the trip rather early .
actually , only the first week in July would be possible with me but I have to tell you that I will be in Hamburg from Tuesday to Friday .
that means that only Thursday or Friday in the first week of July would be possible .
yes , today or tomorrow .
right .
today is a bit too early .
if I could maybe keep you busy at the weekend , next Saturday would of course be possible .
at the weekend is usually fine as I tend to be free then .
Saturday would suit me fine .
you are lucky , you do not have a family .
no , I am single .
all right , I would ,
well , let us agree on Saturday , it has to be possible .
and when ?
how do you feel about the late afternoon ?
well , I would prefer six o &apos;clock then .
six o &apos;clock .
it seems as if we could arrange another dinner .
yes , allow me to make a suggestion this time : here at the Ratzenkammerl they have a very good cuisine .
that is what I naturally expected of you .
thank you for the proposal ,
I do not know this restaurant yet and am eager to get to know it .
fine .
well , maybe we should fix an additional time to talk about the trip again ,
sometime later .
what do you mean by later ?
it might be in August or even at the beginning of September .
as I told you , the last week in August suits me fine and the second one in September .
how do you feel about that ?
well , at the end of August I would be free on the twenty seventh .
that Friday would suit me fine .
we are lucky all the time , I am free then as well .
but that is great .
let us fix that then , too .
and , shall we meet for a business dinner or more privately ?
well , you make me feel awkward now .
I would propose to first meet for dinner , and after that we could maybe go to the theater , who knows ? ا
yes , I will have a look at the program then and my suggestion would be eight o &apos;clock again .
what would you suggest ?
eight o &apos;clock is fine ,
and if you prefer to go to the cinema or anywhere else , just make a suggestion .
yes , we can settle that at short notice .
eight o &apos;clock then , maybe at a hotel or somewhere .
I am not sure .
fine , all right .
I recap then .
when in July did we say ?
that was Saturday , was not it ?
and in August it was the twenty seventh and in September from the tenth to the fifteenth .
that is how we do it .
fine , I am looking forward to a good cooperation and we will talk to each other .
goodbye .
goodbye , see you then .
hello , this is Batliner speaking , $ B $ A $ T $ L $ I $ N $ E $ R .
I think we have to fix a time for a five day business trip to Berlin first .
do you have your diary at hand , too ?
yes , I do have my diary at hand , too .
this is Johne speaking , $ J $ O $ H $ N $ E .
I think we can start to arrange this right away .
I would like to go at the beginning of October or maybe some time in November .
well , the beginning of October is not so good .
I do not think I will be free for five days then .
November would be possible with me , that is the middle of November , for example after the twelfth .
well , after Friday the twelfth it would be difficult with me .
is not it possible with you at the end of October , maybe after the twenty fifth ?
or in November , in the week that includes Memorial day ?
maybe from the eighteenth on ?
well , the end of October is not possible at all and in November I will not have time before the twentieth .
right , that is Saturday .
well the twenty second would probably be better then .
would that suit you ?
well , the earliest possible day for me would be November the twenty ninth .
but after that I would have plenty of time .
November the twenty ninth would be fine .
that would be the twenty ninth ,
the thirtieth ,
one ,
two , three ,
four , well ,
the whole week would be possible with me ,
and the week after and then , well , after the twentieth again .
but maybe the week beginning on November the twenty ninth would be best .
all right , we will leave on Monday the twenty ninth then .
shall we terminate this first arrangement to begin with the second one ?
wonderful , all right .
all right , this is Schmid-M &quot; uller-Bardorf speaking .
I am only going to spell Schmid as that is the most important part , $ S $ C $ H $ M $ I $ D .
I want to fix a time for having a business dinner on a Sunday , if possible in November .
November the seventh would be perfect .
how do you feel about that ?
hello , this is Heilmann speaking .
let me spell it : $ H $ E $ I $ L $ M $ A $ N $ N .
well , this Sunday .
November the seventh is not possible at all as I will be in Leipzig then .
I would be free the week after ,
that is on the fourteenth ,
the twenty first would be possible and the twenty eighth as well .
the other three Sundays would be fine .
my suggestion would be the twenty eighth then because that is Advent Sunday and we could therefore make the business dinner a bit more festive .
all right , that would be nice .
let us fix the twenty eighth then .
fine , we have got that then .
hello ,
this is Oppenrieder ,
$ O $ P $ P $ E $ N $ R $ I $ E $ D $ E ,
Oppenrieder , yes ,
$ E $ R .
we now need a time for preparing a trip within the first week of the monthly schedule .
hello , this is M &quot; uller speaking , $ M $ &quot; U $ L $ L $ E $ R .
my suggestion would be between the first and the thirteenth of October .
how do you feel about that ?
well , on the tenth , eleventh , twelfth , thirteenth I will be in Leipzig .
that is not possible at all .
maybe at two o &apos;clock ?
I will be back from Leipzig on October the eighteenth .
right , I will be coming back on a Sunday .
the eighteenth would be fine .
let us agree on the eighteenth for preparing a trip then .
all right , agreed .
hello , this is Baiersdorf speaking , $ B $ A $ I $ E $ R $ S $ D $ O $ R $ F .
we have to agree on a time for a trip or rather for a preparatory meeting for a trip .
I would suggest , well , between the , the eighteenth or the nineteenth of November if you would have time then .
hello , this is G &quot; unther speaking , $ G $ &quot; U $ N $ T $ H $ E $ R .
excuse me , I did not get you now .
which day would suit you fine ?
November the eighteenth or the nineteenth would suit me fine .
oh , yes , the eighteenth or the nineteenth .
Thursday the eighteenth is really difficult with me , I have virtually no time then .
the nineteenth is completely packed .
please make an alternative suggestion then .
yes , how about November the twenty second in the afternoon ?
that is fine .
at half past nine ?
on November the twenty second .
all right , half past nine is fine .
Roger , over and that is it .
hello , this is Ableitner speaking , $ A $ B $ L $ E $ I $ T $ N $ E $ R .
hello , this is von Juli &quot; s , $ V $ O $ N $ J $ U $ L $ I sharp $ S .
we are supposed to fix a time for a five day business trip .
my suggestion would be November , after the twenty second .
would that suit you ?
the twenty second , that is Monday .
Tuesday is not possible nor is Thursday or Friday .
well , this week is not so good , actually .
an alternative would be the following week , beginning on November the twenty ninth .
would that be possible with you ?
that would be fine , I have no plans for that week .
not before Sunday but that is no problem .
I will be completely free from Monday to Friday .
fine , let us fix the first time right away if that is all right with you .
we only have to settle if we want to do it at or include the weekend or only consider the weekdays .
well , I have plans for Sunday .
if necessary I would have time on Saturday .
I would prefer to simply meet from Monday to Friday .
that are five days and I believe that would be best .
all right , we could do it like this .
fine , we got that then .
another appointment , to find a time for a business dinner on a Sunday in November .
well , Memorial day is not really nice as far as the name is concerned but it would suit me .
that would be the twenty first .
November the fourteenth would suit me as fine .
all right , I would like to introduce myself first .
my name is Schl &quot; or-Quell , $ S $ C $ H $ L $ &quot; O $ R hyphen $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
well , the appointment .
you said November the .
well , I already forgot because of all the spelling .
could you please repeat it ?
yes , I also forgot to introduce myself .
my name is Zelthofer , $ Z $ E $ L $ T $ H $ O $ F $ E $ R .
and I proposed November the twenty first and November the fourteenth .
they would suit me fine .
but Memorial day would be possible with me .
we could arrange a dinner then .
fine , agreed .
that is fine with me as well .
now , we are talking about a third appointment .
my name is Gerholzner , $ G $ E $ R $ H $ O $ L $ Z $ N $ E $ R .
and we have to find a time within the first week of the monthly schedule .
but maybe you could make a first suggestion .
yes , may I also introduce myself ?
my name is Leyweber , $ L $ E $ Y $ W $ E $ B $ E $ R .
and well ,
in the first week of October today would possible with me ,
if we can make it before four o &apos;clock .
or else , Tuesday morning would suit me fine as well .
all right , Monday is not so good with me and Tuesday would be possible with me ,
at a quarter past ten ?
all right , that is fine with me .
as I mentioned , I do not have any plans for Tuesday morning until two o &apos;clock .
therefore we could easily fix a time for Tuesday morning .
let us agree on a quarter past , half past ten .
shall we meet at your or at my place ?
basically , I do not care .
I could come to your place .
all right , let us do that .
goodbye .

Ableitner speaking , $ A $ B $ L $ E $ I $ T $ N $ E $ R .
when would it suit you to do the five day business trip ?
my suggestion would be from May the twenty first to May the twenty fifth inclusive .
that is Tuesday .
would that be all right ?
no , that is not possible with me .
I would prefer June ,
from Friday , June the fourth to Tuesday , June the eighth .
would it be possible to begin on June the eighth , to take five days from that one on ?
that is from the eighth to the thirteenth ?
that is not possible with me .
I would have another suggestion to make , from Monday the fourteenth to Friday the eighteenth of June .
that is not possible either .
how about from the eighteenth to one , two , three , four , five , to the twenty second ?
no , that will not be possible with me either .
would it suit you earlier , in April ?
yes ,
how about from April the fifth to one ,
two ,
three , four ,

well , I have plans then again .
what was your first suggestion in April ?
from the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth of April .
and before , from April the fifth on ?
that is not possible with me .
but I could offer you a time in May , from May the fifth to the ninth .
no , that does not work .
the only thing , yes , after May the nineteenth .
the only problem is that Thursday the twentieth is a holiday .
yes .
that will be difficult .
is it possible ?
if you do not mind being gone for the holiday we could do it from may the nineteenth on .
all right , let us do that .
from the nineteenth to the twenty third then .
wonderful .
Schl &quot; or-Quell speaking , $ S $ C $ H $ L $ &quot; O $ R hyphen $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
we are supposed to meet in a restaurant for business on any Saturday in June .
my suggestion would be the nineteenth .
Zelthofer speaking , $ Z $ E $ L $ T $ H $ O $ F $ E $ R .
the nineteenth .
no , it will not be possible with me on the nineteenth .
I could only offer you the fifth or the twenty sixth of June .
I am sorry but I have plans for the fifth as well as for the twenty sixth .
as I told you , only the twelfth and the nineteenth would suit me .
when would you like to meet ?
shall we meet for lunch or rather for dinner ?
for dinner .
well , I would prefer lunch ,
then the nineteenth would be possible as I have an appointment in the evening , but at midday it would be fine .

wonderful .
hello , this is Leyweber speaking , $ L $ E $ Y $ W $ E $ B $ R .
I would like to talk with you about a time for a meeting in the first week of April .
this is Gerholzner speaking , $ G $ E $ R $ H $ O $ L $ Z $ N $ E $ R .
my suggestion for this meeting would be April the second .
April the second would be fine with me as well .
I do not care , that is up to you .
let us say ten o &apos;clock then .
this is Nadolmy speaking , $ N $ A $ D $ O $ L $ M $ Y .
I wanted to fix a time for preparing a trip with you .
and my suggestion would be to do it sometime between the fifth and the fourteenth of April .
this is K &quot; afer-Plex , $ K $ &quot; A $ F $ E $ R hyphen $ P $ L $ E $ X .
and you suggested to do it between the fifth and the fourteenth ?
that is not so good with me .
although , did you say it would suit you on the fifteenth ?
no .
not on the fifteenth .
how about the following time in June : between the eighth and the sixteenth ?
that is not a bad idea , actually .
shall we fix a time for the eighth then ?
all right , on June the eighth , sometime around noon .
fine , that is all right with me .
when exactly would it suit you ?

in which calendar month please ?
my suggestion would be July .
all right .
what period of time would suit you ?
five days .
I would have time from the eighth to the twelfth of June .
from the eighth to the twelfth of June is not so good .
my suggestion would be the week from the fourteenth to the eighteenth of June .
I would have time from the eighteenth to the twenty third .
I will not be free then either .
that is not so good .
maybe we could postpone it till the end of June .
I would have time from the twenty fourth to the end of June .
I will be busy on the twenty sixth but I would be free from the twentieth to the twenty fifth .
June is packed in my diary .
maybe we could advance the whole thing to May ?
how about the second half of May ?
I would have time then from the twentieth to the twenty fifth .
from the twentieth to the twenty fifth is all right .
from the twentieth to the twenty fifth is possible if we are back by the evening of the twenty fifth .
that is all right .
but we could also begin on the nineteenth already .
nineteen to twenty four .
would that be all right ?
nineteen to twenty four would be fine .
agreed .
all right .
see you then .
hello , this is Schl &quot; or-Quell speaking , $ S $ C $ H $ L $ &quot; O $ R hyphen $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
hello , Zelthofer speaking , $ Z $ E $ L $ T $ H $ O $ F $ E $ R .
I would like to talk about an appointment on a Saturday in June with you , about meeting in a restaurant for business .
which weekend would suit you ?
a Saturday in June ?
the first Saturday or the last Saturday , June the twenty sixth , would be possible .
both days will not be possible with me .
I would only have time on the twelfth or the nineteenth .
I will be busy the weekend on the twelfth and the thirteenth ,

all right , that would be fine .
fine , thank you .
no problem , you are welcome .
hello , this is K &quot; afer-Plex speaking , $ K $ &quot; A $ F $ E $ R hyphen $ P $ L $ E $ X .
I would like to talk about a time for preparing a trip with you .
May would suit me fine , the middle of May .
the week from the tenth to the fifteenth .
would you have time then ?
hello , my name is Nadolmy , $ N $ A $ D $ O $ L $ M $ Y .
the week from the tenth to the fifteenth of May .
from the tenth to the fifteenth of May is not so good .
the week from the tenth to the fifteenth of May is a busy week for me but the week after would be fine .
the week of Ascension day .
yes , that is fine with me as well .
when would it suit you ?
maybe we could agree on the three days before the holiday , between the seventeenth and the nineteenth of May .
well , Wednesday morning is not so good as I am having appointments then .
maybe Wednesday afternoon ?
I will not be free before six o &apos;clock then .
all right , Wednesday afternoon from six o &apos;clock on .

and I would like to fix a time for a five day business trip to Berlin with you .
well , my name is von Juli &quot; s , that is spelled $ V $ O $ N $ J $ U $ L $ I sharp $ S .
well , when would it suit you best ?
well , in November , I would have time in the middle of November and at the end of November or in the second week in December and at the end of December .
what would be the exact times in November ?
as I will not have any time at all between the twelfth and the seventeenth of November .
at the beginning of November it will not be possible ?
I am afraid not , but at the end of November .
how about that ?
I will be free after the twentieth .
that is not good at all .
and already in October , at the end of October ?
from the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth .
no , wait , I am afraid that is not possible .
we would have to meet in December .
when in December ?
the beginning of December would suit me really fine and , roughly , the time from the eleventh to the seventeenth .
we have to agree on the beginning of December then .
would it be possible then already ?
yes , after the twenty seventh .
agreed .
five days , from the twenty seventh to the first .
that is fine .
hello , this is Zelthofer speaking , that is spelled $ Z $ E $ L $ T $ H $ O $ F $ E $ R .
and I would like to fix a time for a business dinner on a Sunday in November with you .
when would it suit you best ?
Schl &quot; or-Quell speaking , that is spelled $ S $ C $ H $ L $ &quot; O $ R hyphen $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
a Sunday in November , I will be available on November the thirteenth .
no , November the fourteenth , November the twenty first or November the twenty eighth .
my suggestion would be to meet right on November the twenty first , all right ?
that would be fine .
hello , this is Gerholzner speaking , that is spelled $ G $ E $ R $ H $ O $ L $ Z $ N $ E $ R
and I would like to talk about a time for a meeting within the first week of the monthly schedule with you .
that would be from the first to the seventh of October if I get that right .
Leyweber speaking , that is spelled $ L $ E $ Y $ W $ E $ B $ E $ R .
and I think that it means between the fourth and the tenth , fourth and the eleventh of October .
what do you think about meeting right at the beginning , during the day on October the fifth ?
that would be between .
I would be free after ten o &apos;clock .
yes , that is fine , I have time then .
hello , this is K &quot; afer-Plex speaking , that is spelled $ K $ &quot; A $ F $ E $ R hyphen $ P $ L $ E $ X .
and we have to fix a time for preparing our trip .
when would it suit you ?
well , my name is Nadolmy , that is spelled $ N $ A $ D $ O $ L $ M $ Y .
and it is any day .
how about tomorrow ?
you mean October the fifth ?
yes , that is okay , I have got time the whole day .
hello , this is Ms Schl &quot; or-Quell speaking .
who am I speaking to ?
this is Zelthofer ,
I know that many people have difficulties spelling it therefore I tell you .
that is $ Z $ E $ L $ T $ H $ O $ F $ E $ R .
yes , thank you .
my name is a hyphenated name , by the way , and it is spelled $ S $ C $ H $ L $ &quot; O $ R hyphen $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
all right , I got that .
am I right to assume that you are calling me because of an appointment on Sunday or ,
well , I do not know if you would be free right next Sunday .
I will not have time then , for example .
just tell me what your diary says about your time at the moment .
well , I would appreciate to meet in November ,
but you are right , I am calling you because of the business dinner .
and , well , I am quite flexible in November , actually .
as to Sunday , it would suit me on November the seventh already , for example .
would that be possible with you ?
no , that will not be possible with me as I will be in Leipzig then .
but tell me , are you busy all the time in October ?
because in October I would ,
I would still be available on the twenty fourth .
otherwise , if you do not have time on the twenty fourth , I would not be free before the fourteenth of November .
and that is the day of national mourning .
the Sunday after , the twenty first , is Memorial day .
it seems to be a little bit difficult .
would you mind meeting on the fourteenth , or rather , would you have time then ?
I am afraid , on the fourteenth I have
I just realized that I can not get away on the fourteenth myself .
otherwise the twenty eighth would be possible with me as well .
no , the twenty first would be fine .
I only have to ask my relatives if they would mind me having a business dinner on Memorial day .
but as far as I am concerned we could fix that for now .
all right , you could give me further notice .
and apart from that , it would be possible in any case , would not it ?
I am looking forward to it .
fine , thank you , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , this is Gerholzner speaking .
who am I speaking to ?
this is Leyweber speaking .
oh , my cousin is called like that as well .
how do you spell that ?
that is $ L $ E $ Y and Weber $ W $ E $ B $ E $ R .
all right , that is spelled differently then .
probably there is no relationship then .
if you need my name , it is spelled $ G $ E $ R $ H $ O $ L $ Z $ N $ E $ R .
all right .
could you please repeat that ?
I did not get the last bit .
yes , of course , it is $ G $ E $ R $ H $ O $ L $ Z $ N $ E $ R .
thank you , now I got it as well .
well , tell me , why was I supposed to call you ?
my secretary told me something wrong there .
well , we have to fix a time for a meeting we wanted to hold together ,
if possible within the next week or , well , yes .
my suggestion would be tomorrow then .
that is Tuesday , October the fifth .
I will actually be completely free after ten o &apos;clock .
before , I have an appointment , it is not possible then , but afterwards I will be completely free .
well , shall we say half past ten then , in order that it is a bit more convenient for you ?
yes , wonderful .
do you have a little more time then ?
or rather how long
I would have time the whole day , actually .
well , we could maybe have lunch or dinner together if it takes a little bit longer .
but otherwise I am quite flexible , I will actually be free .
how do you feel about meeting in the rotating restaurant in the Olympic village ?
right at half past ten .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
not in the Olympic village , no .
you know , I will think about it .
I will call you again tomorrow morning ,
very early , before your first appointment .
and by then I will have come up with something good .
all right , fine .
see you tomorrow then .
see you tomorrow , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
I hope this is right .
this is Ms Nadolmy speaking .

it is $ K $ &quot; A $ F $ E $ R hyphen $ P $ L $ E $ X .
thank you , that is great ,
I put that down .
I would like to fix , well , a time for preparing a trip with you .
do you know about that ?
yes , preparing the trip .
well , you know ,
you know that I am always a little bit confused , you notice that ,
it is important , I think .
I appreciate that ,
I consider it to be a very good idea .
we should really prepare it in detail .
please tell me , when would it suit you ?
well , I am really not that fixed , I would say .
and I do not think we really have to hurry .
there still is some time before the trip ,
but if it is possible with you I would appreciate to meet this month still .
well , yes , I actually have ,
well , I will be off from the nineteenth to the twenty first but apart from that I do not have any appointments .
how about you ?
my suggestion would be Monday , October the twenty fifth then ,
if nothing unexpected happens or if I do not forget it , it would be a really good day for me .
well , Monday it is like that :
I have ,
I am not available at all between eleven and four o &apos;clock .
we would either have to meet very early or else ,
or we would have to find another day of the week as Monday , well , is the busiest day for me .
all right , well , it should not be too exhausting and , well ,
we should not be under pressure .
I would suggest Wednesday the twenty seventh then .
yes , that would suit me really fine , I will be completely free after one o &apos;clock .
we could , yes , spend the whole afternoon together to talk about everything .
would that be possible with you ?
perfect .
my suggestion would be to have lunch together sometime after one o &apos;clock .
why do not you call me when you are back from you are appointment and we go together then ?
that is great .
I note that right away .
I will call you on Wednesday , October the twenty seventh at one o &apos;clock then .
fine .
thank you , goodbye .

I would also like to introduce myself , my name is von Juli &quot; s .
let me spell it : $ V $ O $ N $ J $ U $ L $ I sharp $ S .
well , the business trip , we have to fix a time for it , right .
I am just having a look at my diary to find out when it would suit me .
it is five days long .
that would be possible with me from July the twentieth on .
how do you feel about that ?
I am afraid I will not have time on July the twentieth ,
I will already be busy with another appointment then .
but I have another suggestion to make ,
and that is from July the sixth on ,
the week from July the sixth to July the ninth .
well , I would only be free in the time between the twentieth of July and the second of August .
are you completely busy then ?
no , I am sorry .
but as I told you I will be busy after July the twentieth .
an alternative suggestion of mine would be in August , from August the third to the ,
wait , I just noticed that this is out of the question as there already is an appointment on Monday .
I am now having another suggestion to make .
how about September , from the thirteenth to the seventeenth of September ?
yes , that would suit me really fine , that would be perfect .
mhm , shall we meet then ?
all right , let us agree on that time .
from the thirteenth to the seventeenth of September .
I will contact you as soon as I will have arrived in Hannover then .
yes , let us do it the way we have arranged it and you will contact me again .
fine .
thank you for the discussion .

hello , Mr Zelthofer ,
can I help you ?
yes , could you also tell me your name , please ?
it is easier to talk with each other then .
my name is Gerholzner .
let me spell it : $ G $ E $ R $ H $ O $ L $ Z $ N $ E $ R .
all right , let us go on with what we are having on the agenda .
all right .
well , I would like to fix a time with you .
to meet in a restaurant on a Sunday in August .
in August , on a Sunday ?
I am just having a look at my diary .
how about August the twenty second ?
well , I just realize that I am already busy on that day .
I would have time on August the first or the twenty ninth .
how do you feel about that ?
the first is out of the question ,
but we could envisage the twenty ninth of August for an appointment .
fine , let us stick to the twenty ninth then .
if that is all right with you .
it is .
just tell me where and when , please .
well , it would be near the university , in Schellingstra &quot; se , in the Schellingsalon .
all right , I agree .
at half past eleven .
fine , agreed .
thank you very much .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , this is Ableitner speaking .
let me spell it : $ A $ B $ L $ E $ I $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I have to fix a time for a meeting within the first week of this month .
could you put me through to the person in charge , please ?
yes , I will be pleased to do that for you .
the person in charge is Ms Leyweber .
let me spell it : $ L $ E $ Y $ W $ E $ B $ E $ R .
fine .
Ms Leyweber , we have to hold a meeting within the first week of this month , of July .
and I would ,
I have quite a lot of free days then
well , is this only a one day appointment or is it over a couple of days ?
it is supposed to be only one day and , basically , it is only a short meeting .
all right , I make a suggestion then .
how about July the second , third , fourth , sixth , seventh or eighth ?
would it be possible with you on one of these days ?
a weekend is included there .
my suggestion would be to confine ourselves to one of the workdays .
Monday or Friday , that is the second or the fifth of July , would suit me quite fine .
well , I am afraid I am already busy on Monday but Friday would not be bad , actually .
all right , Friday is fine with me as well , I will be free the whole day then .
but I would suggest to hold this meeting in the morning already .
would you have time then as well ?
oh , excuse me , I just realize that I will already be busy with another appointment on Friday .
I completely failed to notice that now .
then it would only be possible with me on Monday and on Thursday .
that would be the eighth of July .
yes , it would only be possible with me on the eighth of July .
are you already occupied that day ?
the eighth of July is really not so good with me as I will be in Hamburg for one week then .
well , I see , we are having a problem with the appointment .
maybe we could switch to the second week in July .
oh , I just realize that I would have some time on the first of July .
would you have time then ?
well , that would be today .
then , I would also have time today .
but we will have to hurry then , of course .
just tell me when .
yes , that would be really fine .
maybe at two o &apos;clock , this afternoon ?
well , we would either have to do it before or meet after seven o &apos;clock .
how about having dinner together ?
we could talk about it while having a nice meal .
oh , I do not offend at all , especially as you are having such a nice voice .
shall we meet at eight o &apos;clock at the Kir Royal hotel ?
that sounds very good .
all right , let us do that .
I am looking forward to it .
see you then , goodbye .

let me spell it : $ K $ &quot; A $ F $ E $ R $ P $ L $ E $ X .
well , you wanted to talk about a time for preparing a trip with me .
that should not be a problem .
how about the time between July the twentieth to July the thirty first ?
you gave me a long time there , that is fine .
I am afraid I will be busy on two of those days and that is on Tuesday and on Thursday .
but I would have time the three other days in that week .
maybe you could choose a time then ?
are you talking about the first or the second week ?
the exact days I would have time on are Monday the nineteenth ,
Wednesday the twenty first and Friday the twenty third .
well , on the nineteenth it will not be possible with me but I think you also mentioned Wednesday the twenty first .
I would have enough time then .
all right , let us fix that .

all right , that is fine .
we will meet at your office .

Mr Ableitner , this month is pretty bad for me
next month from Monday the twenty second of November to Friday the twenty sixth of November , would you have time then ?
this is bad because I am in Schwerin on Thursday and Friday .

the week starting the twenty ninth of November looks good to me , too .
can we agree upon this date ?

Mr Schl &quot; or-Quell , I would like to make an appointment with you for a business meal on a Sunday in November .
a Sunday in November , let me see .

I could offer you the twenty first of November
I am free the twenty first of November , too .
shall we fix this ?

hello .
my name is Leyweber .
it is spelled $ L $ E $ Y $ W $ E $ B $ E $ R .
Mr Leyweber , I would like to make an appointment with you for a short conference in the first week of October .
would the first week of October suit you ?
or are you already booked then ?
I think you are talking about the week from the fourth of October ?
exactly . this means , today is Monday , during this week .
what about today ?
I am free until four $ P- $ M
today before four $ P- $ M is bad , because I am exactly booked until four $ P- $ M
no , after four $ P- $ M I am not free
what about tomorrow , before two $ P- $ M ?
tomorrow before two $ P- $ M suits me well .
it only has to be a short conference .
I would have time after ten $ A- $ M if you want .
yes , let us take ten $ A- $ M then , if it suits you .
ten $ A- $ M is very fine .
let me repeat , tomorrow Tuesday the fifth of October at ten $ A- $ M at your place .
let us fix that
hello
my name is K &quot; afer-Plex . it is spelled $ K $ &quot; A $ F $ E $ R hyphen $ P $ L $ E $ X .
hello , Mr K &quot; afer-Plex
this is Nadolmy , $ N $ A $ D $ O $ L $ M $ Y speaking .
Mr Nadolmy , we should fix a date to prepare our trip .
it should be as soon as possible .
yes , let us see if we can meet this week .
maybe Wednesday afternoon .
Wednesday afternoon is bad for me .
Thursday afternoon would be better .
what do you mean by afternoon ? before or after two $ P- $ M ?
after two $ P- $ M
after two $ P- $ M is pretty bad .
I am booked until eight $ P- $ M
this means we have to switch to Friday .
how do you feel about Friday ?
on Friday I am free the whole day .
we could meet then .
okay on Friday from nine to ten I have a doctor &apos; s appointment but I am free afterwards .
what do you think about Friday at eleven $ A- $ M at your place ?
yes , that is okay .
thanks , okay , I will see you on Friday , goodbye .
hello .
my name is Ableitner , it is spelled $ A $ B $ L $ E $ I $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I call to fix a date with you for a five day business trip to Berlin .
it would suit me in November , after the twentieth .
hello .
my name is von Juli &quot; s . it is spelled $ V $ O $ N $ J $ U $ L $ I double $ S .
before that I have two dates free in October .
the first date is between Tuesday the fifth until Wednesday the thirteenth or from Friday the twenty second of October to Sunday the thirty first of October .
I have important appointments in that time .
the earliest date for me would be the twelfth of November .
from the twelfth of November to the seventeenth of November I would be free and again from the twentieth the whole November to the fourth of December .
but after the twenty seventh ,
which is free according to you , until the ninth of December I am free in any case .
I suggest to go from the twenty seventh of November to Thursday , the second of December .
this is possible for me .
let us fix this .
hello .
my name is Zelthofer , which is spelled $ Z $ E $ L $ T $ H $ O $ F $ E $ R .
and I call you to make an appointment with you for a business meal on a Sunday in November .
how do you feel about that ?
you are talking to Mr Schl &quot; or-Quell , a double name , $ S $ C $ H $ L $ &quot; O $ R hyphen $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
you said an appointment on a Sunday for a business meal in November .
I could offer you Veterans-Day , which would be the fourteenth .
it would be also possible to meet the Sunday before Advent ,
the twenty first or the first Sunday in Advent ,
the twenty eighth .
let me repeat . on Veterans-Day ,
the fourteenth of November ,
a Sunday is impossible for me . but on the twenty first the Sunday before Advent it is possible for me .
on the first Sunday in Advent , the twenty eighth of November it is possible for me , too .
I would say to take the first Sunday in Advent , as I do not think that the Sunday before Advent is appropriate .
I think so , too .
thank you very much and goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , Mr Schl &quot; or-Quell .
I call because we forgot to fix a time when we made the appointment for our meal .
I would suggest to meet a twelve $ A- $ M .
at twelve $ A- $ M at the wonderful fish restaurant at the sea .
that is fine with me .
good bye , thank you .
great .
hello .
my name is Leyweber .
let me spell it for you , $ L $ E $ Y $ W $ E $ B $ E $ R .
I am calling to make an appointment with you for a short conference during the first week of this month ,
that means from today ,
Monday the fourth of October to next Monday the eleventh of October .
how do you feel about that ?
hello .
you want this week already ?
I would have time from Tuesday to Thursday and on Friday after three $ P- $ M .
on the ninth I am going to Dresden , I will not have time then .
we could take Tuesday .
I will be free after ten $ A- $ M
Tuesday after ten $ A- $ M .
if the conference does not take too much time .
I have to be at another place at two $ P- $ M
but ten $ A- $ M would suit me fine .
we could fix Tuesday the fifth of October ,
which is tomorrow , Tuesday , at ten $ A- $ M for our short conference .
thanks , goodbye .
hello .
my name is Nadolmy , $ N $ A $ D $ O $ L $ M $ Y .
who am I talking to , please ?
hello .
you are talking to K &quot; afer-Plex , a double name , $ K $ &quot; A $ F $ E $ R hyphen $ P $ L $ E $ X .
we could fix a date to prepare our trip .
when would you have time in the near future ?
amazing how you could guess this .
I actually wanted to make this appointment with you .
for me it would be possible to meet from the fifth to the seventh of October or later from the eighteenth to the twenty first .
how do you feel about that ?
the last date from the eighteenth to the twenty first is not possible for me ,
but on October the nineteenth , a Monday , after twelve o &apos;clock would suit me fine .
no ,
I would say that it is not that urgent , as the trip does not take place before next year .
we can always postpone it to November or December if you would prefer it .
yes ,
in principle I would prefer it since I am free from Friday the fifth of November to Thursday the eleventh of November , where we could talk about our preparations of the trip .
you would have to go to Leipzig then because I will be there then .
this is bad .
what do you think about the beginning of December or from the sixth ?
the sixth of which month please ?
of December .
beginning of December would suit me very well .
on Thursday the second of December I could not make it before two $ P- $ M .
this is okay with me .
we could fix this date then if you like .
then I suggest Thursday , the second of December at three $ P- $ M ,
this would leave me time to have lunch .
we will meet in my office to talk about our trip .
is that okay with you ?
yes , that is all right with me .
goodbye , thank you .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is Ableitner $ A $ B $ L $ E $ I $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to make a five day business trip to Cologne with you .
when would you have time ?
hello
this is von Juli &quot; s speaking , $ V $ O $ N $ J $ U $ L $ I double $ S .
if it suits you ,
we could already meet in April . I would have time for a five day trip from the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth .
if this suits you we can perhaps agree upon this .
this is not so good because I am not here from the twenty fourth to the twenty sixth .
but what do you think about Saturday the fifth of April to the tenth of April , which is Easter Saturday ?
this does not suit me ,
because I have a date from the eighth of April until Easter Monday .
so this is not too convenient .
maybe we could meet in May from the fifth until the ninth if you are free then .
this is bad , too . I am booked then .
but what do you think about the twenty seventh of April to the first or second of May ?
this would not be bad , but I am already booked from Whit Monday .
I am free then .
this is on Ascension day .
this would be in conflict with one of my dates in Wiesbaden .
what about the days after Ascension day , from the twenty first to the twenty fifth or twenty sixth of May ?
I could make it from the twenty first to the twenty fifth , but I would have to be back on Tuesday around seven $ P- $ M because of a date .
we can surely leave Cologne early enough to be back in Munich in the evening .
yes , excellent .
let us do it this way and meet the twentieth , on Ascension day .
I will see you then .
good bye .
okay , thank you .
good bye .
hello , this is Zelthofer speaking , $ Z $ E $ L $ T $ H $ O $ F $ E $ R .
I would like to make a date with you for a business meal , if it is possible on a Saturday .
I would suggest the first Saturday in June , the fifth .
it would be excellent if you would have time then for a business meal .
hello .
my name is Schl &quot; or-Quell , $ S $ C $ H $ L $ &quot; O $ R $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
unfortunately , the first Saturday in June , Saturday the fifth is pretty bad because I am booked the whole day .
but what would you think about the twelfth , the second weekend in June ?
I am sorry but now it is me who already has a date ,
but we could meet the nineteenth for lunch . on the evening I am already booked .
maybe you are free then ?
this would be great because on the nineteenth I am free the whole day .
I would suggest to take the nineteenth and fix this date .
okay , let us meet the nineteenth and I am looking forward to this lunch .
good bye , see you then .
okay , good bye .
hello .
my name is Gerholzner , $ G $ E $ R $ H $ O $ L $ Z $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to fix a date in the next few days for a short conference .
when would you have time ?
hello , Mr Gerholzner .
my name is Leyweber , $ L $ E $ Y $ W $ E $ B $ E $ R .
in the next few days for a short conference .
for example we could already meet tomorrow , Friday the second .
is that okay ?
I will be free the whole day .
you could choose the time .
Friday the second would suit me very well .
I am free the whole day , too .
let us say that we meet for lunch at one $ P- $ M .
does this suit you ?
yes , for lunch at one $ P- $ M .
oh , I just notice that I am booked until three $ P- $ M , I have a date then .
would it suit you to meet for dinner or some time after three $ P- $ M ?
that is no problem for me .
we could certainly .
let us meet at eight $ P- $ M for dinner , if it is okay with you .
okay , eight $ P- $ M for dinner .
this suits me very well .
I will see you tomorrow .
good bye .
see you tomorrow .
good bye .
hello .
this is K &quot; afer-Plex speaking , $ K $ &quot; A $ F $ E $ R , hyphen , capital letter $ P $ L $ E $ X .
we could .
we should fix a date to prepare our trip if that is possible .
I certainly do not know when you are free , that is what I wanted to ask you .
hello .
my name is Adolmy , $ N $ A $ D $ O $ L $ M $ Y .
I am relatively flexible with my dates .
what do you think about Monday , the fifth of April ?
I would be free the whole day .
this coincides excellently .
on Monday the fifth I am not booked at all , no dates yet .
I would suggest to prepare our trip on the fifth , if it is okay with you .
this would suit me very well .
where should we meet ? at your or at my place ?
maybe you can already come to lunch , around one $ P- $ M .
we can take all the time we want to talk about our trip .
we can look at it very calmly .
let us meet on Monday , the fifth .
very good .
let us meet on Monday the fifth around one $ P- $ M at your place .
I will be there .
I am looking forward to this .
thank you .
goodbye .
see you then .
goodbye .
my name is J &quot; ansch .
which is spelled $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
and I would like to make a five day business trip to Cologne with you in June .
my name is G &quot; urtner .
$ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
the five day business trip to Cologne would suit me well at the end of April or beginning of May
I could make in April , too . That was a fault .
one , two ,
three , four ,
five , for example at the end of April from the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth .
this does not suit me well .
I cannot make it before the twenty seventh .
but I am not free on the twenty ninth .
let me see . I could make it in May from the fifth to the ninth .
I am booked then .
but in May I am free from the eighteenth .
let me see .
one , two ,
three , four ,
five , okay let us make it from the eighteenth .
eighteenth , nineteenth ,
twentieth to the twenty second .
wait , one , two , three , four , five , yes eighteenth to twenty second .
I just notice that I am booked on the eighteenth .
but I could make it as of the nineteenth .
let me check this again .
one , two , three , four , five , yes that is okay , too .
from the nineteenth to the twenty third .
that suits me , too .
so we have arranged this .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
and we should make an appointment for a business meal on a Saturday .
yes indeed , and I would say , I can tell you that I am free on every Saturday ,
except the nineteenth in the evening .
and I would make an appointment with you , for example , on the fifth of June .
I cannot make it then ,
but the twelfth of June does suit me , we should consider this date .
I just notice , I failed to see that I am not free the twelfth and the thirteenth .
I could make it the nineteenth in the afternoon , well at noon for lunch or the twenty sixth .
yes the nineteenth does suit me very well .
let us arrange that .
yes , I would suggest to meet at one $ P- $ M
yes that suits me . okay .
okay .
hello .
I would like to make an appointment with you .
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
for a short conference during next week .
hello .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
yes , the first week , that would be between the first and the eighth of April .
it would suit me Friday or Monday and Wednesday , for example .
yes ,
on Monday I am free the whole day , Wednesday I could make it in the morning and on Friday in the afternoon .
I would like to suggest Monday first .
yes , on Monday I am the whole day free , too .
let us make it Monday morning , maybe at ten $ A- $ M .
yes , that suits me fine .
let us make it at ten $ A- $ M .
okay .
hello .
my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
we should make an appointment to prepare a trip .
I would suggest to meet in the near future , between the fifth and the seventeenth of April .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
yes , if we say the fifth and the seventeenth of April , for example the fifth in the afternoon at three $ P- $ M
yes , this suits me very well .
let us arrange the next Monday already .
okay .
hello .
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
I call because of our date for a five day conference in Cologne .
hello , Mr J &quot; ansch .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
yes , let us start to plan .
I would have time in the first week of April .
unfortunately , that does not suit me .
in April , if it is possible at all , we can only make it from Saturday the twenty fourth to Wednesday the twenty eighth .
yes , okay .
I am sorry , but I just notice that I have an appointment then that cannot be postponed .
the next date I could offer you is not before May , in the time between the eighteenth and the twenty second .
yes , that would suit me very well , too . this would be very nice .
let us make it from the eighteenth to the twenty third .
excuse me , I have to correct this .
I just notice that on the eighteenth I have a meeting around noon .
what do you think to start on Wednesday the nineteenth ?
yes , Wednesday the nineteenth would be possible , too .
it would be from Wednesday the nineteenth to Monday , the twenty fourth inclusively .
it is no problem for you that Ascension day , a holiday , is in between there .
no , it is no problem .
okay , I think we can fix this date then .
good , I thank you .
I thank you , too .
hello .
the reason for my call is the business meal we arranged for June .
we have to agree on a Saturday in June .
and I first have to inform you that I am booked the fifth and the twenty sixth of June .
yes , Mr Quell , my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
you will not have time neither the fifth nor the twenty sixth .
let me think , the only date remaining would be Saturday the nineteenth .
the meal has to be before seven $ P- $ M though as I already have an appointment between seven and ten $ P- $ M
Mr Walberg , it is a pity that we will be restricted to such a short time , but in principle I agree with you .
why do not you propose a time when we should meet ?
let us simply say Saturday the nineteenth at one $ P- $ M
yes , that is fine , thanks .
I thank you , too . goodbye
hello .
my name is K &quot; opp .
let me spell it for you $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .

hello , Mr K &quot; opp .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
for the short talk between us I have to tell you that it would suit me , for example , today ,
already today , Thursday .
let me first tell you when I can not make it at all .
this would be next Saturday , the third and Thursday the eighth .
I think we can arrange something anyhow .
as the matter is a little difficult and as I do not have any further appointments for today ,
I suggest to meet today .
we should agree upon a time .
late afternoon around four or five $ P- $ M .
yes , this is no problem for me .
then I would simply say today at four thirty $ P- $ M .
okay , then I write this down and I will see you this afternoon around four $ P- $ M .
thank you .
goodbye .
hello .

as you will have noticed , the von is not directly a part of the name .
as soon as possible to prepare our trip .
during this week ?
it is not that urgent .
but okay ,
April suits me very well ,
for example Monday the fifth or from Wednesday the fourteenth to Friday the sixteenth .
as I would be happy to get this done as soon as possible , I would suggest to take the fifth .
if we could agree upon a time , maybe in the evening , six $ P- $ M ?
yes , in the evening at six $ P- $ M would suit me .
it will not take long .
let us simply say Wednesday , what did you say , Wednesday the seventh .
no , I suggested Monday .
okay , Monday the fifth at five $ P- $ M .
yes , Mr Flex , I write this down and thank you for talking to me .

it would suit me very well .

I am busy from nine $ A- $ M to two $ P- $ M .
what do you think of Thursday afternoon after two $ P- $ M ?
I have an appointment at three $ P- $ M on Thursday afternoon .

some time in there .

a moment please , one , two , three .

okay , this would be possible .
so we can fix this .
from the twentieth to the twenty fourth we will go to Cologne .

Mr Nadolmy , we should make a date to prepare our trip .
exactly , when shall we make it ?
yes , in principle I would like to make it as soon as possible .
okay , what about Friday , tomorrow ?
tomorrow morning I would be free until one $ P- $ M inclusively .
no , I am not free tomorrow morning .
I am only free tomorrow afternoon .
Friday is impossible then .
what about Monday , the fifth of April ?
yes Monday , the fifth is fine .
I am free the whole day .
I would propose to meet on Monday at ten $ A- $ M .
okay , we will make it on Monday at ten $ A- $ M
and where ?
could you come to my place at Neuperlach ?
yes I can do that .
and where exactly ?
the best would be to wait at the gate and let somebody call me .
okay , let us make it like this .
see you then . goodbye .
goodbye , Mr Nadolmy .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I plan to make a five day trip to Hannover and I wanted to ask you when it would suit you , when you would be free .
hello .
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
no , this does not suit me .
the twentieth would not be too good , because I already have an appointment then .
on the twentieth I will be in Augsburg .
it would be possible to take the twenty eighth of July .
no , although I just notice that I have an appointment on the twenty ninth , too .
maybe in the beginning of August .
the beginning of August would be the best for me .
for example from the first to the fifth of August .
no , it is impossible .
from the third to the eighth of August .
this looks bad for me , I am not free then .
I would be free in the end of July from the thirteenth to the seventeenth of August .
this includes a holiday .
I do not know whether this would make sense .
the next would be the end of August .
earlier would be bad for me .
for example as of Tuesday the twenty fourth I would have some time .
on the twenty fourth I have a date in Dresden , this would not be possible .
I think that July and August has to be ruled out .
maybe it could be in September ,
if you would have time in September ?
the beginning of September , from the first to the eighth would be ideal .
I have no further obligations then .
then I have .
from Saturday to Wednesday I will be in Leipzig ,
from the fourth to the eighth in Leipzig .
it would suit me better from the ninth .
ninth to the seventeenth .
okay , I have a date on Saturday and Sunday ,
maybe I can cancel that .
I would prefer that .
the middle of September would be ideal .
I would be free from the tenth of September to the nineteenth of September .
and if you could cancel your appointment on the weekend , we could agree upon the middle of September .
yes this is all right with me .
let us say from Friday , the tenth to Thursday , Wednesday the fifteenth ,
in the end , this will be it .
or Thursday would suit me , too .
yes , great , we can fix this date then .
I would be free , Friday the tenth .
okay , thank you very much .
I thank you .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I wanted to ask ,
whether you would have time in August , on a Sunday in August , for a business meal ,
to go out to eat .
hello .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E double $ L .
a Sunday in August .
I need to look briefly in my diary .
the first Sunday would not suit me , I have other obligations then .
maybe the second Sunday , the eighth .
that Sunday is bad for me , because I am on a business trip then .
what do you think about this Friday , the fifteenth ?
I am on vacation on the fifteenth .
that is impossible .
I will be out of town then .
maybe the twenty second .
I have a meeting at our company then .
the last possibility for me is the last Sunday , the twenty ninth , if it would suit you .
Sunday the twenty ninth .
yes , the twenty ninth is great .
okay , let us say , we will meet on Sunday at six $ P- $ M at the restaurant Gasthaus zur Post if it suits you .
yes , that suits me .
I will see you on Sunday the twenty ninth .
okay , goodbye .
hello .
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O double $ P .
and I wanted to make an appointment during the first week with you .
and it would be on Thursday the first of July already , if it is possible for you .
hello .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
on the first Thursday .
that would be the first .
yes , that would be possible for me .
what time would you prefer ?
yes , the best would be in the afternoon , right after lunch .
maybe around two $ P- $ M , if it suits you .
wait , no , wait .
I just see on my plan , that I already have other obligations from two to seven $ P- $ M
I would prefer the morning .
this would suit me , too .
this would be on Thursday , the first of July , let us say at nine $ A- $ M ?
yes , nine o &apos;clock is okay . let us say nine $ A- $ M
okay , see you on Thursday .
yes , see you on Thursday , thank you .
hello .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I wanted to ask , whether you have some time during next week for an appointment to talk about the preparations for the trip .
hello .
my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
yes , what do you think about Monday , for example ?
some time in the late morning if you like .
late morning is bad because I already have other appointments then .
maybe around noon , from twelve to four $ P- $ M , approximately .
I would have time then .
yes , that suits me well , too .
twelve to four $ P- $ M .
where would you prefer to meet ?
shall we meet at my or at your place or in a restaurant ?
yes , let us meet on neutral ground in a restaurant .
in the restaurant Wirtschaft zur Post again .
okay , then I will see you on Monday .
twelve to four $ P- $ M .
yes , see you on Monday . goodbye .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R
I am supposed to arrange a common business trip to Hannover with you .
is that right ?
yes , that is right .
I want to introduce myself , too .
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
and for the five days to Hannover I can offer you to start the twentieth of July .
from the twentieth of July it looks a bit tight .
I think I can only find five days in a row in August , as of Tuesday the third of August .
would that be possible ?
this is not possible at all because I already have an appointment then .
if it is possible in August , then only in the end , as of the twenty fourth of August .
the twenty fourth of August I will be in Dresden and apart from that I have several dates during that week .
I think we will not get together before September .
that does not suit me .
but I just noticed that I am free for exactly five days from the thirteenth of August , including Assumption day .
unfortunately those dates are already marked in my diary .
I think we should try to find a date in September .
maybe a little bit later ?
perhaps from the Friday , the tenth .
I would be free for a longer period then .
yes , that would suit me well , too .
five days from Friday the tenth .
we could fix this .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I want to make an appointment with you for a business meal on a Sunday in August .
I would have time on the fifteenth of August and the twenty ninth .
to make sure that you get to know me , I will introduce myself quickly .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E double $ L .
you said the fifteenth and the twentieth .
the fifteenth I am not free because I will be out of town on vacation .
but the twentieth , the Friday , is exactly right .
we could meet then .
but this is no Sunday .
maybe we should take the twenty second then .
I am already booked on the twenty second .
there is only the twenty ninth remaining .
or we would have to postpone it .
the twenty ninth is a very good date .
I think we should combine this with a business meal .
maybe in the restaurant Vier Jahreszeiten .
how do you feel about that ?
then we will meet on the twenty ninth of August in the restaurant Vier Jahreszeiten .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
we should make a date for a short conference during this week .
what do you think about meeting me today already ?
hello .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
and on Thursday I would be free the whole day .
okay . let us meet at one $ P- $ M
maybe right in our office ?
yes , let us meet on the thirteenth in your office .
great , that suits me well .
okay , see you then .
goodbye , Mrs Niehmeyer .
hello .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
and we still have to prepare our business trip .
I think one afternoon will be enough .
sometime during this week .
today is Thursday .
what do you think about today ?
please let me introduce myself .
my name is von Sudniz , von $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
today is not so good , but tomorrow would be a good day .
Friday the second .
on Fridays I am always booked the whole day .
this is pretty bad .
I do not know if you have time for the preparations on a weekend .
okay , let us make it on a weekend .
maybe on Saturday the third already ?
okay , I would suggest the morning .
maybe we could have breakfast together .
very nice .
see you then . goodbye .
okay .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
who am I talking to , please ?
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
I would like to arrange a five day trip to Hannover with you .
when would you have time for this ?
August would suit me very well .
the best would perhaps be right the beginning of August .
it is very bad for me then .
I am out of town from the third to the eighth .
later would be bad for me .
maybe we should switch to September .
and what do you think about the ninth and the seventeenth of September ?
I have an appointment on the ninth from eight $ A- $ M to twelve thirty .
but we could start the tenth or even the twelfth .
I would prefer the tenth , because I will be leaving town afterwards .
otherwise I would be short of time .
that we go to Hannover together from the tenth to the fifteenth .
okay , I agree .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
hello , Mrs Walberg .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
Mrs Quell , I would like to invite you to a business meal on a Sunday in August .
when would you have time ?
what time in August do you have in mind ?
rather the beginning or the end of August ?
it would suit me very well on the eighth of August or later on the twenty second of August .
if this would suit you .
on both days ,
the eighth , no , I will still be out of town then and on the twenty second I am will not be here either .
wait , the fifteenth would suit me , that is Assumption day .
do you have time then ?
I am unfortunately booked on the fifteenth .
yes , on the twenty ninth I am free .
hello .
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
who am I talking to , please ?
this is Mrs Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
I would like to make an appointment for a short conference with you , during the first week of July .
is that possible for you ?
which day are you thinking of ?
generally , Friday the second of July would suit me , for example .
this means tomorrow .
it would suit me very well , if we would have a short conference tomorrow .
at what time would it suit you ?
we could meet after lunch , maybe at two $ P- $ M in my office ?
okay , that is all right by me .
goodbye .
goodbye .
this is Mrs Flex speaking , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I would
who am I talking to ?
hello , Mrs Flex .
my name is von Sudniz .
let me spell it for you $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
Mrs Sudniz ,
I would like to meet you to prepare our little trip we planned in more detail .
now we should
what time did you have in mind ?
I think it should be as soon as possible .
it depends on which day would suit you best .
for me the Wednesday would be very convenient .
on Wednesday I am totally booked until three $ P- $ M
for me Monday and Thursday would be
if you could make it then somehow .
Monday mornings I have appointments and in the afternoon , too . but we could meet Thursday morning .
if you have time then .
that we plan to make it Thursday morning .
that is fine .
okay , would it suit you on the fifteenth of July ?
wait .
I am out of town on the fifteenth of July .
I would have time on the twenty second of July .
I am out of town on the twenty second of July .
I will be in Augsburg then .
how would it suit you on Thursday the fifth of August ?
unfortunately I will not be here either .
I will be away for a longer period of time .
in August I could make it on the twenty sixth .
unfortunately I am already booked on the twenty sixth , too .
on the second of September I have an appointment until five $ P- $ M
this would be too tight .
let us go back to August
what do you think about the nineteenth ?
yes , the nineteenth of August would suit me fine .
maybe we could meet at nine $ A- $ M ?
I agree , okay .
thank you , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
I have to arrange a date with you for a five day business trip to Berlin .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would have time from the twelfth of November .
that is impossible for me .
later it would suit me from the twentieth of November .
could you make it from the twentieth of October , too ?
November is pretty bad for me .
no ,
I am sorry . I unfortunately have an appointment on the twenty second of October and on the twenty sixth of October , too .
then it would be possible from the sixth of December .
I cannot make it on the sixth of December either .
what about the eleventh to the sixteenth of December ?
I will not have time before the seventeenth .
then I could suggest to go from the fourth to the tenth of November or already during the next week .
let us say from the eighth of October to the twelfth of October approximately .
no . I am totally booked then .
what about the time around Christmas ?
between the twentieth , between the seventeenth and the twenty seventh I am free for ten days .
if we could take five days in there ?
twentieth to twenty fourth of December .
is that all right ?
yes , that is possible .
very good .
thank you .
hello .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
I would like to make an appointment with you for a business meal on a Sunday in November .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I could propose the seventh of November already .
would that be possible for you ?
no , I am sorry .
I would only have time on Veterans-Day ,
the fourteenth of November , on the twenty first of November and on the twenty eighth of November .
Veterans-Day is impossible for me , but the twenty first of November would suit me .
would that be all right ?
yes . that is fine with me .
thanks .
hello .
my name is Niehmeyer .
I want to make an appointment with you for a short conference during this week .
let me spell my name for you , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
yes , I would today . I am not free any more
on Tuesday I would have time the whole day , except between two and four $ P- $ M .
excuse me , my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
on Wednesday I would have time in the morning until two $ P- $ M and on Thursday I am free in the afternoon after two $ P- $ M .
I would propose to take Tuesday at ten $ A- $ M , ten to eleven $ A- $ M
is that all right ?
yes , thank you very much .
my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I am free during this week on Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Tuesday and Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon .
and after that only from the eighteenth of October .
my name is Flex . $ F $ L $ E $ X .
and I suggest to agree on Thursday .
you said that you are free in the morning or in the afternoon .
Thursday afternoon suits me fine .
okay , then I would suggest to already meet at two . $ P- $ M .
is that all right ?
that is all right .
hello .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I would like to make an appointment with you during the first week of this month .
today is the fourth of October .
when would you have time ?
I would suggest , maybe on a Thursday .
this would not be too bad .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
and the date in the first week , on a Thursday would suit me .
on Thursday the seventh .
yes , the last problem would be the time .
I would prefer the morning .
yes , that is all right .
great .
so we have fixed the first date .
what time ?
maybe around nine $ A- $ M .
this would not be bad .
okay . at nine o &apos;clock on Thursday the seventh of October .
good .
hello .
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
when would this be possible for you ?
the best for me would be between the twenty second of October and the thirty first of October .
by the way , my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
this is relatively bad for me , as I have several other appointments during this time .
what do you think about the end of November ?
perhaps from the twenty second of November ?
unfortunately I am in Schwerin on the twenty fifth and the twenty sixth of November and therefore cannot make it then .
but another possibility could be from the eleventh to the seventeenth of December .
would it possibly be convenient for you to make it one week earlier ?
from the sixth to the tenth ?
yes , from the sixth to the tenth I would be free , too .
but this would not be five days .
this means that we would have to leave on the fourth and come back on the ninth ,
because of a date I have on the tenth .
I have an appointment on the fifth .
it would be right in between there no , this will not go .
no , we cannot make this .
the week before does not suit you and as of the twenty second is not possible for you either .
and if we should make it during this week ?
no , this will not go either , I am not free then .
maybe either from the twentieth of December to the twenty fourth of December or from the fourth of November to the eleventh of November .
I would be free during this time .
the first suggestion you made would suit me better .
this is in December from Monday the twentieth of December to the twenty fifth .
exactly .
see you on the twentieth of December .
goodbye .
great . goodbye .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I would be free on the seventh of November , this is a Sunday .
the next dates I am free would be the twenty first of November and the twenty eighth of November .
it would be nice , if we could find a date then .
hello .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
the fourteenth would suit me or the twenty first or the twenty eighth would suit me , too .
I would propose to take the twenty first of November .
very well .
so we will meet on the twenty first of November at nine $ A- $ M at the station .
thank you . all right .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is Quell .
I would like to make an appointment with you to prepare a trip .
my name once again Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
I would suggest to make this as soon as possible .
would this week be possible for you ?
hello .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
this week .
it would be very nice if we could make this on the fifth already .
I would be free on the fifth , too .
what do you think about meeting me at nine o &apos;clock in the morning ?
why do not you come to my office at nine in the morning and we will see how to go on .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to make an appointment with you for a five day business trip to Cologne .
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
and I would have time from Monday the fifth of April to Friday the ninth of April .
sorry , I do not have time then .
it would suit me from Saturday the twenty fourth of April to Wednesday the twenty eighth .
how do you feel about that ?
looks pretty bad for me .
but let me offer you a compromise .
what about Friday the twenty first of May to Wednesday the twenty sixth of May ?
unfortunately I have an appointment on Tuesday evening .
this will not go .
but if we could start the seventeenth of May , the Monday , it would suit me well .
could we start one day later , on Tuesday ?
let us make it from the eighteenth for five days .
okay , from Tuesday the eighteenth to Sunday the twenty third .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
it is about a date for a business meal on a Saturday in June .
one Saturday in June I would be free is the twelfth .
does this suit you , too ?
hello .
may I introduce myself first .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
no , I do not have time on that Saturday .
I would have time on the nineteenth .
if we could meet for lunch .
I already have plans for the evening .
great , this suits me very well .
I am happy to hear this .
goodbye .
goodbye .
and I would like to arrange a meeting with you .
my name is spelled $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R
it is about the short conference during this week .
and I would propose to meet , let us say , this evening .
today is Thursday the first .
as far as the date is concerned it is okay with me .
and to enable you to write down my name , K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O double $ P .
nice talking to you , Mr K &quot; opp .
okay , see you this evening .
my name is Mr Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
and it is about the last and the fourth appointment scheduling to prepare a trip .
we have to get together some time .
it can be whenever we want .
I would suggest in May , a Friday we have another meeting then for five days .
let us say Monday the tenth of May .
does that suit you ?
hello .
this is von Sudniz speaking , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I have no time on this day .
what do you think about Wednesday the sixteenth of June ?
Mr von Sudniz , this is great . this suits me , too .
wonderful .
see you on the sixteenth then .
goodbye .
all right .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to make an appointment with you for a five day business trip to Bonn .
tell me , would you have time on Thursday the fourth of February ?
hello .
unfortunately I do not have time on the fourth of February to go on a trip with you .
but maybe we can make it from the eighth to the fourteenth , that we can go for five days .
I am sorry Mr J &quot; ansch .
this is impossible for me .
and if we would make it in January ?
from Wednesday the thirteenth for example ?
I cannot make it on the thirteenth , but maybe on the fourteenth .
but we would not have five days anymore because I need to be in L &quot; ubeck on the eighteenth already .
it would consequently be more convenient to go on the twentieth .
maybe on Ash Wednesday ?
from Ash Wednesday the twenty fourth to the beginning of March , we could make it then and go out of town .
if we should leave one day later , it will be all right .
that is the twenty fifth .
we will go from the twenty fifth to the third then , if I see this correctly .
I think that five days will be enough and that we will come back on the first if you do not mind .
yes , sure .
thank you .
goodbye .
okay . goodbye .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G , Walberg .
I would like to make an appointment with you on a Saturday in March .
on the thirteenth I am booked already .
apart from that we could meet on any Saturday you should prefer .
hello , Mr Walberg .
this is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L speaking .
Saturday the sixth would suit me well .
excuse me I was checking February and not March .
I would have time on Saturday the twentieth .
you said that you were booked on the thirteenth .
hello , Mr Quell .
that is the first day of spring , nice weather and things like that .
then we will go out for a great business meal .
maybe we should meet already for lunch and spend a fantastic day together .
goodbye .
okay , I am looking forward to it .
see you then . goodbye .
hello .
this is K &quot; opp speaking , $ K $ &quot; O double $ P .
hello , Mr K &quot; opp .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
Mr K &quot; opp , we wanted to make a date for a short discussion during the first week .
for me it looks as follows , I would have time on Tuesday and on Friday .
what do you think about the fifth , that is tomorrow already ?
let us say tomorrow evening .
as of four $ P- $ M perhaps ?
it would suit me fine then .
if the evening already starts at four $ P- $ M for you .
then we will make it at four $ P- $ M in the evening .
and we will have a great conference then .
goodbye .
see you then .
hello .
my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
hello , Mr von Sudniz .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
we need a date to prepare our trip .
what do you think about making it this week ?
maybe on Saturday the ninth , that we get together for a little while then ?
on weekends it is pretty bad for me .
I would prefer to do this during the week .
as it is still early in the morning , what do you think about meeting today for lunch ?
yes , for lunch .
if you agree on meeting me at two $ P- $ M
I would have time until six $ P- $ M then .
it would suit me to meet you then .
no , this is too late for me .
the latest for me would be to meet you from twelve o &apos;clock to two $ P- $ M
no , maybe we should make it on Tuesday then .
perhaps what about Tuesday the twelfth ?
I would have time for you during the whole day , Mr von Sudniz .
no , I am sorry , but I do not have time then .
I would be free the whole day on Wednesday .
it would be up to you then to meet me for lunch , in the evening or in the morning
unfortunately , the thirteenth is impossible for me .
but maybe the following Wednesday , the twentieth in the morning .
that would be all right .
in the morning , I would be at your place around nine $ A- $ M and we could then plan how to go on .
yes that is nice .
this suits me , too . great
okay , see you then .
I will see you at nine $ A- $ M on the twentieth .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner .
it is spelled $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
who am I talking to ?
my name is J &quot; ansch .
good I am connected correctly .
I call because we should make a five day business trip to Bonn .
when would it suit you ?
maybe in January ?
January would be convenient for me , but this week looks bad though .
I just notice that I will not have time before the last week of January and it is partly booked , too .
I am sorry , but we have to postpone it to February .
February is bad for me .
what about March ?
in my diary I see that I would have time during the first week of March .
and I have appointments afterwards , which I cannot postpone .
no , I just notice between the fifteenth and the nineteenth .
on the sixteenth I am booked between three and five $ P- $ M
but from the eighth to the thirteenth of March would be better .
this looks bad for me .
what do you think about the first week of March ? .
I am only free until Wednesday then .
that is pretty bad .
and if we include a weekend in our trip ?
would that be possible ?
yes , but not during the first week in March .
let me just check this .
if we go from the eighth , ninth , tenth no these are only four days .
you said that you had an appointment on the sixteenth , is that right ?
that is right .
okay , this would also be too short .
the end of March , what about the end of March , from the twenty fourth ?
there is a note for the twenty seventh .
but in three days we will not be able to fit in all our appointments
if we go back to February and include a weekend ?
or if for example I could make if from the thirtieth of January , a Saturday , to the fourth of February .
it would be possible from the eighteenth of February including the Monday preceding Ash Wednesday .
this is again bad for me .
I cannot make it before Ash Wednesday .
my next appointment then is on Thursday the eleventh of March .
starting on Thursday after Ash Wednesday would suit me .
great , let us fix this .
okay .
let us make it like this .
thank you very much .
hello .
my name is J &quot; ansch .
we are going on a business trip to Cologne together .
you probably have already heard of me .
J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
my name is G &quot; urtner .
you possibly have not heard of me yet .
it is spelled as follows , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
a five day business trip is a thing that has to be planned thoroughly .
which date would be convenient for you ?
what did you have in mind ?
is it possible for you to make it this month ?
is it possible in April ?
this month would be possible .
would , let us say , the middle of April be convenient for you ?
in the middle of April I do not have five whole days .
it would be possible for me from the fifth of April to the ninth inclusively , what includes good Friday .
this is pretty difficult for me , as I am religious , but we could
as of which day did you say ?
it would be possible for me from the fifth of April to the ninth inclusively .
this would be from Monday to Friday .
what do you think of Wednesday the seventh ?
and the following day will naturally be holidays .
yes , it is problematic because of the holidays .
maybe it is possible in the end of April .
from the twenty seventh on , that is a Tuesday .
Tuesday , wait , yes this is possible .
we will leave on Tuesday the twenty seventh and will come back on Saturday the first , if I see this correctly .
am I wrong to take five days into account ?
this is absolutely correct and so far as I am concerned we can make it .
from Tuesday the twenty seventh to Saturday the first , which is May day .
can we fix this ?
yes , that is how we will make it .
we will go to Cologne then .
goodbye .
thank you very much for talking to me .
I thank you , too .
hello .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
we urgently have to talk about some things with your company .
and I would like to arrange a dinner with you on a Saturday in June .
would you have some time in June , on a Saturday ?
you usually negotiate with my partner .
you are now talking to Mrs Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I am prepared to take it over , as my partner is pretty busy in the moment .
June suits me very well .
if I may suggest a day , maybe Saturday the twelfth ?
this is not convenient for me .
the fifth would be more convenient for me .
this fifth is not possible .
we already have another business dinner then .
but what about the nineteenth ?
the only thing instead of a dinner we could go out for lunch .
I have two business meals on one Saturday then ,
and will be getting fatter and fatter , but we could go out for lunch , if you wish .
I do not want to push you into this but this would be the only possible day for me .
so if you do not mind , we would go out for lunch then .
we go to the salad bar then .
let us fix this date and go out for lunch on this Saturday .
thank you and goodbye .
see you , we talk again and arrange a restaurant and other details .
goodbye .
goodbye , Mr Quell .
hello .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking ?
I do not know if this is a pleasure .
but this is Mr K &quot; opp speaking . $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
hello .
hello .
which day would be most convenient for you ?
in principle this week does not look bad .
what do you think about doing it today ?
today already .
what time is convenient for you ?
right now .
where are you ?
I do not know if I can make it so quickly to come to this date .
right now I am about two meters south of you .
I think we can make it .
okay , I will be in your office in five minutes .
shall we fix this ?
see you soon .
hello .
my name is von Sudniz , von ,
$ V $ O $ N ,
you see that I am of noble birth ,
and Sudniz ,
$ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
when you have noticed that I am of noble birth and that my name is von Sudniz , I want to ask you to urgently meet me and talk about our trip next week ,
not next week ,
what am I talking , about our trip we planned last week when we met at the bar and wanted to fly to Kenya together .
and we wanted to talk about it , about the technicalities and whatever .
and I would suggest , that we get together as soon as possible and think about the day on which we want to fly to Kenya and if we want to take my Safari gun or whatever we want to do .
can you think about a date when we could get together to talk about our trip to Kenya ?
first of all , as far as the name is concerned I do not have a noble name .
my name is simply Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
and I have already heard that we need to get together .
during this month it looks pretty bad though .
if it is absolutely necessary I would suggest to meet in the beginning of May .
I thought we were calling each other by the first name .
once again , the beginning of May .
let me just ask my secretary .
she says no , she says no and believes I should perhaps
what do you think about starting on the fifth of May would suit me fine .
what do you think about this ?
I am sorry , but I have to clearly say no to this .
from the fifth on it is bad .
maybe after all we should go back to the end of April .
the end of April is not too good .
what do you think of Monday the seventeenth of May ?
I am sorry , I am on another conference then .
you see , that you are talking to a very busy woman .
what about Wednesday the nineteenth of May ?
one moment .
this is great .
Wednesday is the preparation for Fathers-Day , too .
that is good .
at what time shall we meet ?
this depends on the matter you want to talk about with me .
if we need the whole day or just an afternoon .
I will be free both in the morning and in the afternoon .
then I would say that we should take the evening .
if you would rather do it then .
so that we do not miss a day at work .
let us go out in the evening , let us talk in the evening .
this is all right with me .
let us fix this .
I will pick you up with my Mercedes Benz at your company , on Wednesday the nineteenth , let us say at seven $ P- $ M
would that be convenient for you ?
I would have to work very long then , but if you cannot make it , seven $ P- $ M at my company .
unfortunately it is impossible to go earlier .
I am a very busy man , but I can meet your wish as much as this , let us say six thirty $ P- $ M
okay , six thirty at my company .
goodbye .

G &quot; urtner is spelled $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .

when are you free ?
it would suit me best in November , from the twelfth ,
thirteenth ,
fourteenth , fifteenth ,
three , four ,
five to the sixteenth .
I am sorry , this does not suit me at all .
if it has to be in November it should be before that .
fifth and the the following days till the tenth .
I am sorry but I will be in Leipzig then .
then not until the eighteenth .
would that be possible for you ?
not exactly the eighteenth but maybe from the twentieth .
this is pretty bad for me , because I have an appointment then .

no , unfortunately I am totally booked in the end of October .
in the beginning of October , starting the eighth ?
I am sorry .
I am out of town from the eighth to and including the seventeenth inclusively .
and later , in December ?
this depends on the days we choose in December .
I am free between the sixth and the fourteenth .
sixth and fourteenth .
is it impossible for you till the fifteenth ?
no , on the fifteenth and the sixteenth I am already booked , too .
let us get back to November then .
I do have an appointment on the twenty third , but I could cancel that .
this would be from the eighteenth of November on .
as I said ,

okay , I need to postpone the other appointment then .
let us say from the twentieth .
okay , from the twentieth .

I think we talked on the phone , we talk to make an appointment for a five day business trip to Cologne .
I would like to start .
when would you have time ?
I would like to make it in June .
yes , June would suit me , too .
for example from the fourth of June or from the fourteenth or from the twenty fourth .
unfortunately I am booked then .
I think that you are booked in June , except for the dates you named .
very convenient for me would be for example Wednesday or Tuesday the eighth of June or from the eighteenth on .
if this should not suit you , in May , including a weekend , from the twenty first of May would suit me , too .
in May would be all right .
that suits me , too .
your dates in June do not suit me unfortunately .
in May from the twenty first on ?
yes , in May from the twenty first on .
that is the twenty first , twenty second till the twenty fourth .
all right .

it is a Tuesday .

at seven $ P- $ M I have another appointment .

for me it is no problem to start at nine in the morning with an open end or to make it later on .

hello .
my name is Luger .
it is spelled $ L $ U $ G $ E $ R .
what is your name , please ?
hello .
my name is Sagerer , $ S $ A $ G $ E $ R $ E $ R .
I would like to arrange a five day business trip to Cologne with you .
could you please check when this would be possible for you ?
would you be free in April ?
let me just check .
no . in April I do not see any possibility .
June would be more convenient .
June would suit me , too .
we would have to include a weekend then .
it would suit me from Tuesday the eighth of June to the twelfth of June , a Saturday .
would this suit you , too ?
this does not suit me , because I am already booked on Saturday .
this would be from Monday the fourteenth of June to and including Friday the eighteenth without a weekend .
I am sorry .
I am booked on Thursday the seventeenth .
I would be free from the eighteenth of June to the twenty second of June .
what about you ?
yes , that is okay .
we have arranged a five day business trip to Cologne then , from the eighteenth to the twenty second of June .
the next date now .
hello , Mrs Luger
I failed to see something when we were scheduling our date a little while ago .
we have to change the date we fixed .
let me suggest you something else .
would you possibly be free from the seventeenth to the twenty first of May ?
I am sorry .
I am booked on the seventeenth and on the eighteenth of May as well .
I would be free though from the nineteenth of May to and including the twenty third of May .
okay , it can be done like this .
let us leave it as it is .
hello .
my name is Walberg .
I would like to arrange an appointment with you on a Saturday in June for a business meal .
it would suit me on the twelfth of June , for example .
does this suit you , too ?
hello .
my name is Quell .
I am already booked on the twelfth of June .
what would you think about the fifth ?
now it is me who is booked then .
the nineteenth of June would suit me , too .
what time did you have in mind ?
I leave it to you .
I am free the whole day , but perhaps in the evening at seven $ P- $ M .
no that does not suit me , as I am already booked from seven to ten $ P- $ M .
the last possibility would be to make it on the twenty sixth of June .
now this does not suit me .
we consequently have to make it on the nineteenth of June .
I agree , let us fix this .
five to seven $ P- $ M on the nineteenth of June .
hello .
my name is Luger , $ L $ U $ G $ E $ R .
I would like to invite you during this week , that is either today or between the first and the eighth of April , for a short conference .
when would you be free ?
hello .
my name is Sagerer , $ S $ A $ G $ E $ R $ E $ R .
the first of April would suit me .
it would suit you today , then .
I am also free during the whole day .
shall we agree upon two $ P- $ M ?
yes , two $ P- $ M is okay .
are you free for two hours , from two to four $ P- $ M ?
yes , that is possible .
hello .
my name is Flex .
it is spelled $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I would like to meet you ,
if possible on a working day in June , to talk with you about the preparations for the trip .
it would suit me fine on the eighth of June .
would this suit you , too ?
hello .
I have no objections to the eighth of June .
that would be all right .
I would suggest to fix Tuesday the eighth of June in the morning at ten o &apos;clock .
yes . that is okay .
what do you think how long this will take approximately ?
one hour at least , two hours if possible .
that is from ten to twelve then , if possible .
yes , all right .
let us stick to it .
hello .
my name is Allalouf , $ A double $ L $ A $ L $ O $ U $ F .
who am I talking to please ?
hello .
my name is Matth &quot; ai , $ M $ A double $ T $ H $ &quot; A $ I .
I would like to go on a five day business trip to Hannover with you .
when would it suit you ?
between July and September , if that is possible .
I would like to go on a trip with you , too .
I could suggest between the twentieth of July to the second of August , as I will be free the whole time then .
would you be free in this period for five days ?
I am sorry
I have many appointments in this period of time .
it would suit me from the third of August on , though .
I would be free from the third till the ninth of August .
what about you ?
that is impossible for me .
it will not suit me until the twenty fourth of August .
Tuesday the twenty fourth of August .
now it is me who has an important date then .
between the first and the eighth of September .
this is not possible either .
I will be in Leipzig then .
it would suit me from the ninth of September .
missed for one day only .
I would again be free from the tenth of September .
maybe you are free for five days some time between the tenth and the nineteenth of September .
during the period between the tenth and the nineteenth of September , I could offer you to go from the tenth to the fourteenth .
this includes a weekend though .
that is the reason why I would prefer Monday the thirteenth to Friday the seventeenth .
does this suit you , too ?
great .
from Monday the thirteenth of September to Friday the seventeenth .
this is fixed .
see you soon .
thanks and goodbye .
hello .
my name is Kronenbach .
it is spelled $ K $ R $ O $ N $ E $ N $ B $ A $ C $ H .
I call you , because I would like to go out for a meal with you on a Sunday in August , if possible .
which Sunday would suit you ?
are you sure that you want to go out for a meal with me ?
my name is $ P $ E $ T $ Z $ O $ L $ D .
as far as your voice is concerned , I am totally sure .
the only question is , if you can really arrange to be free on a Sunday .
I will try to .
I am free on Assumption day .
this is the fifteenth of August .
how sad .
would it be suitable for you on the eighth of August , too ?
no , I am not free on the eighth of August unfortunately .
there is only the twenty ninth left .
we could go out for dinner on the twenty ninth of August .
great
that suits me , too .
I would suggest to pick you up at seven $ P- $ M .
is that all right with you ?
with pleasure .
see you then and goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
I hope , I am connected correctly with Mrs G &quot; urtner .
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O double $ P .
yes , you are connected correctly .
you already know my name .
nevertheless I will spell it for you $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
what is the matter , please ?
the management , we want to arrange a short conference together .
you perhaps have some time during this week still .
tomorrow would be suitable for me , if it is possible for you ?
I am sorry .
tomorrow , on Friday , I will go to the theater .
I would prefer next week , from Monday the fifth of July .
exactly the fifth of July does not suit me .
I will be back on Wednesday the seventh of July .
I would be free then , but not before three $ P- $ M .
this is inconvenient , as I will be in Hamburg between the sixth and the ninth of July .
I probably have to cancel the theater then .
I really do not want you to cancel the theater .
we could perhaps make it at a short notice , today .
I would be free the whole afternoon .
today I am only free before two $ P- $ M or after seven $ P- $ M .
this is up to you .
if you wish to make it before two $ P- $ M I would hurry up and come to you .
but it would also suit me after seven $ P- $ M .
I would say this evening after seven o &apos;clock .
you come to my place then .
see you then and goodbye .
okay , see you then , goodbye .
hello .
my name is R &quot; ossner .
it is spelled $ R $ &quot; O double $ S $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to meet you in July , if that is possible , to talk about our trip .
first of all I tell you that I will not be in town from the sixth to the ninth of July .
apart from that I will frequently be free .
when would it suit you ?
did I understand correctly , sixth to ninth of July ?
you misunderstood .
from the sixth to the ninth I will not be in town .
apart from that , the week between the twelfth and the sixteenth would suit me fine .
I am booked on the thirteenth of July .
on the twelfth , fourteenth , fifteenth and sixteenth I will be free .
that is not possible for me .
usually I am only free on Mondays and on Thursdays .
what do you think about the nineteenth of July ?
at two $ P- $ M if you wish .
yes , that would suit me .
goodbye .
okay , I will be there .
thanks and goodbye .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I have been instructed by my company to arrange a five day business trip to Bonn with you and I wanted to ask you , when you would have time ?
hello .
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
this will be problematic .
why do not you propose a date ?
it would suit me fine in the middle of March .
if you have time then .
I would prefer the beginning of March .
I am free from Monday the first till Thursday the eleventh .
I will be on a conference then .
from Monday the eighth would be better for me .
I am afraid I can not help you there .
I have an appointment from the twelfth to and including the fourteenth .
what about Monday , the fifteenth to Saturday the twentieth ?
as far as I can see , I already have a date on Tuesday the sixteenth .
but we could agree upon the twenty first of March or the twenty second of March .
I again have a date in between there , on the twenty third .
but it would be possible from the twenty fourth .
I am still free from the twenty fourth till the end of March .
I have to disappoint you , too .
I have dates , which I cannot postpone then .
would you be free in February ?
in February I would only be free from Monday the eighth to Sunday the fourteenth .
I have a gap then .
apart from that I will not be free for five days in a row .
I am sorry .
and what about January ?
during the two coming weeks , maybe from the thirteenth ?
Wednesday the thirteenth of January .
I unfortunately only have .
there are again two dates in between there .
I could offer Wednesday the twentieth to and including Thursday the twenty eighth .
I have a gap without dates .
last chance .
get in quickly .
I unfortunately only have time from the twenty seventh .
I will be abroad until Monday the first of February .
how do you feel about that ?
what was the date you proposed ?
was the departure on the second of February ?
I can only go from the thirtieth of January to the fourth of February .
I have to disappoint you again , as I will be out of town then .
I cannot go before the fourth of February till the seventh or eighth of February .
this is bad for me .
you do not have time from Monday the eighth to the thirteenth , do you ?
no , I am sorry .
I will already be in Italy then .
we both will not have time until March , as far as I can see this .
I would suggest to talk again at the end of March and try to find a date then .
I just noticed .
are you already booked on the twenty fifth of February ?
I am free on the twenty fifth of February till Thursday the eleventh of March .
this is fourtunate .
there are no appointments marked in my diary from the twenty fifth of February .
this means that the twenty fifth ,
twenty sixth ,
twenty seventh ,
twenty eighth of February and the first of March would be free for our business trip to Bonn .
what do you think ?
that suits me perfectly fine .
let us fix this date
from the twenty fifth of February to and including Monday , the first of March .
okay , I agree .
let us meet at the airport and take care of further details then .
I am pleased , too .
my secretary will send you the papers .
goodbye .

my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
it is nice of you to call me .
I could offer you the first Saturday in March , the sixth of March .
I am awfully sorry
but I already have other plans for this weekend .
what do you think about the second Saturday , the thirteenth of March ?
I have to disappoint you , but I am not at home that weekend .
but the twentieth would be possible and the twenty seventh , too .
the twentieth would suit me fine , as I am out of town on the twenty seventh .
if this suits you we could meet Saturday evening for a business dinner and make further arrangements then .
great
let us meet on Saturday at eight $ P- $ M in front of the restaurant Bayrischer Hof , okay ?
eight $ P- $ M at the Bayrischer Hof .
I will be there .

hello , Mr K &quot; opp ,
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R ,
I first have to tell you that I am pretty busy next week .
I would perhaps be free on Monday afternoon between three and six $ P- $ M .
I am very sorry .
but between three and six $ P- $ M on Monday the fourth no .
we are talking about today .
I have other plans already .
I would prefer Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday afternoon ,
this is the fifth of the sixth of January .
Tuesday suits me perfectly fine .
I am free the whole day on Tuesday the fifth of January .
why do not you suggest a time ?
I just notice that Wednesday is a holiday , we could meet in the evening then .
and we can combine the short meeting with a dinner .
and we can then talk about everything else .
I would suggest eight $ P- $ M in the hotel Vier Jahreszeiten .
great , no objections .
a very good choice .
I will see you on Tuesday the fifth of January at eight $ P- $ M .
exactly , I am looking forward to the dinner .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is von Sudniz , von $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I want to make an appointment with you .
as you know , we have to go on a trip together .
and I think it is very important to get together before and talk about certain matters .
hello Mr Sudniz ?
did I get that correctly ?
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
how do you feel about this afternoon ?
I am sorry .
today , on the fourth of January I am not free in the afternoon .
what about tomorrow the fifth of January ?
on Tuesday I never have too many appointments .
yes , I principally do not have any objections .
I have not got any plans for tomorrow yet .
we could also make an appointment on Wednesday or in three or four days , on Friday afternoon .
that would suit me , too .
the day after tomorrow I would only have time in the morning .
in three days , on Friday I would again be free for the whole day .
this would suit me fine , too .
we could take all the time we need because of the weekend .
okay , let us say Friday , at three $ P- $ M ?
great .
let us meet on Friday at three $ P- $ M in front of our company .
you know where to go .
we will talk about the details for our trip then .
goodbye .
see you on Friday .

my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
who am I talking to , please ?
hello .
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
Mrs J &quot; ansch , I would like to plan a five day business trip to Berlin with you .
when would you have time for it ?
I have already been thinking about that .
what would you think about the end of January ?
in the end of January I am pretty busy ,
I could only make it from the twenty seventh of January to the thirty first ,
as I am out of town for five days before .
I am sorry .
unfortunately I already have an appointment on the twenty ninth of January .
in the middle of February , from Monday the eighth to Sunday the fourteenth I would be free .
I will also be out of town then .
that is pretty bad .
wait , five days , this is in March , from the eighth to the fifteenth .
no , this unfortunately is exactly the time when I already have a date .
I am already booked from the twelfth to the fourteenth .
it would still be possible in the end , from the twenty fourth to the thirty first I would be free .
unfortunately I am out of town on the twenty seventh of March .
what would you think about doing it very soon and perhaps go tomorrow ?
no , I am sorry .
January is very bad as my dates are spread over the whole month .
tomorrow I will leave town again for three days .
and on the thirteenth I have an appointment , too , that would not go either .
maybe in the beginning of March , I could offer you the time between the first and the eleventh .
you are not free until the twelfth , as I will not be back before the eighth of March .
otherwise we could go from the eighth to the twelfth .
do not you have some time before that , maybe in the end of February ?
I would be free from the twenty fourth , Wednesday the twenty fourth till March .
in March I will be free until the eleventh .
we could perhaps make it around the end of February , beginning of March ?
on the twenty fourth , that is Ash Wednesday , I will be in Dresden .
I would have time afterwards , from the twenty fifth to the first of March .
yes , that would be great .
this is Wednesday , twenty fourth , Thursday twenty fifth , Friday , Saturday , Sunday to and including Monday the first .
this suits me perfectly fine .
excuse me , I still will not be back on the twenty fourth .
I will still be out of town .
this means to go from the twenty fifth , twenty sixth to and including the first .
okay , I made a mistake .
twenty fifth to the first of March .
we will send you the papers .
where shall we meet and when ?
I think we can check the papers when we meet .
let us simply meet on the twenty fifth at the airport ?
great .
okay , thanks for your call .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I give you a call because of the business meal .
I think we are supposed to get together on a Saturday in March .
is that correct ?
hello , Mrs Walberg .
yes , that is correct .
the business meal should take place in March , right ?
when would you be free ?
I would be free , no , not in the beginning of March .
from the thirteenth on I will be free on every Saturday in March .
unfortunately I am already booked on the thirteenth .
but I could offer you the twentieth of March .
Saturday the twentieth or Saturday the twenty seventh of March if you wish .
I failed to see that I am away on the twenty seventh , too .
but it would also suit me on the twentieth .
we fix this date then , do not we ?
this suits me perfectly fine .
what about eight $ P- $ M in the evening ?
yes , that is fine .
shall we go to the same restaurant as last time ?
then we will meet on Saturday the twentieth at eight $ P- $ M
in front of the restaurant Bayrischer Hof ?
okay , all right
thank you , Mrs Walberg
goodbye .

I would like to make an appointment with you to prepare a trip .
yes , right , it is still on the agenda .
then we could
I would like to get this done as soon as possible .
what are your plans for example for Thursday ?
Wednesday is a holiday , on Thursday ?
but I would not be free until the afternoon .
no , I am sorry , this is bad for me .
I am already booked in the afternoon .
it would suit me this afternoon between two and six $ P- $ M or perhaps tomorrow during the day ?
tomorrow I will be free .
we could meet in the morning , for example .
I could also offer you in three days , on Friday , if you should prefer that .
maybe for lunch ?
or on Tuesday , tomorrow , for lunch , if you wish .
if you are also free on Friday , I would prefer that .
we will meet for lunch in the Greek restaurant ?
yes , great .
in three days , on Friday , then .
that is the eighth , is not it ?
Friday , the eighth .
yes , that is correct .
I am looking forward to it .

goodbye .
hello .
this is Mr G &quot; urtner speaking .
who am I talking to , please ?
my name is spelled $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
you are talking to Mrs J &quot; ansch . $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
what is the matter , please ?
I would like to make an appointment with you .
for a five day business trip to Berlin some time in October , November or December .
it depends on when you would have time .
it would suit me fine in the last week of October , from the twenty fifth of October to the twenty ninth of October .
I do not know if you are free then .
no , I have two appointments then and I have to be present , unfortunately .
it would suit me well between the twenty second of November and the thirtieth of November for example .
now it is me who has two appointments then .
can we possibly include a weekend or a holiday in the trip or does it has to take place during the week for you ?
for example between the sixth and the fourteenth of December .
between the sixth of December and the fourteenth of September would suit me perfectly fine .
it will be possible , if you are free then
I said December .
if it is in December we should make it .
it would be best to go from the sixth to the eleventh of December .
great
then I will talk to you before or I will see you directly on the sixth of December then , I guess .
all right .
hello .
this is Mrs Walberg speaking , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
who am I talking to , please ?
hello .
this is Mr Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
what is the matter , please ?
the matter is a business meal on a Sunday in November .
do you have any suggestions when it would suit you ?
yes , for example on the fourteenth or on the twenty first or on the twenty eighth .
please check when it would suit you best .
the twenty eighth would suit me best .
we can make it then if you do not mind .
okay , on the twenty eighth then .
okay , I will see you there .
goodbye .
hello .
this is Mr K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
who am I talking to , please ?
to Mrs Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
the matter is as follows
this is the coming week from the fourth to the ninth .
it would only be a short conference .
I just wanted to ask you when you would be free .
Thursday would suit me perfectly fine ,
I am free the whole day .
Friday after ten would be possible , too , if you are free then .
Friday at ten is great .
I am free then , too .
let us make it on Friday at ten $ A- $ M , this is the eighth of October .
although , no
I have an appointment there , I am booked then .
what do you think about Monday morning , between nine $ A- $ M and four $ P- $ M ?
nine $ A- $ M and four $ P- $ M is a little bit too long .
but I would be free between nine and eleven $ A- $ M
and as it only is a short conference , this should not be a problem .
of course , that is fine .
okay , let us make it like this .
if it is only eight o &apos;clock now .
then we will make it in an hour .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
this is Mrs Flex speaking , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
who is on the line , please ?
I am Mr von Sudniz , von $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
what is the matter please ?
the matter is an appointment for travel preparations .
perhaps during this or the next week .
when would it suit you ?
it depends on how long the talk about the preparations would take .
Tuesdays in the morning , Wednesdays in the morning and Thursdays in the afternoon .
if you would be free on Thursday afternoon it would be fine .
perhaps around three $ P- $ M ?
yes , that suits me .
okay . let us make it on Tuesday at three $ P- $ M
very nice , goodbye .
hello .
this is G &quot; urtner speaking , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I call because of the five day business trip to Berlin .
we wanted to arrange this appointment .
hello .
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H ,
I would suggest to go from the eighth of October , Friday , to the twelfth of October , Tuesday .
I am sorry , I will be in Leipzig then , that is impossible for me .
what about November ?
twenty second till the end of the week ?
this is not possible for me , unfortunately .
I have another suggestion .
do not you have time in October ?
would you be free from the twenty second for five days ?
it looks pretty bad on the twenty second as I am booked then , and on Tuesday I have an appointment , too .
do not you have any time at all in October ?
did I get that correctly ?
because I would have time in October from the twenty second on .
I am totally booked then .
I will not be free until December .
what do you think about the first of December , a Wednesday ?
in principle this is okay , but I am booked on Sunday the fifth
this is bad for me because I am already booked on Friday the tenth .
what about the week from Saturday the eleventh of December to Wednesday ?
I would only have time till Tuesday then .
on Wednesday and Thursday I am booked
but after that , from the seventeenth to the twenty seventh I will be free .
that is fourtunate .
then we can fix the date from the twentieth to the twenty fifth .
does this suit you ?
yes , that is fine .
from the twentieth to the twenty fifth .
all right , thank you .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .

what about Sunday the fourteenth ?
I am already booked on Sunday the fourteenth .
would you be free on Sunday the seventh ?
unfortunately I will be on a business trip to Leipzig then .
what about the first Sunday in Advent , the twenty eighth ?
the first Sunday in Advent is possible for me .
yes we could do that .
all right , we take the twenty eighth , the first Sunday in Advent for our business meal .
hello .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R
and I would like to meet you during this week for a short conference .
it would be very convenient for me if we could fit this into this week .
what about Tuesday , Tuesday morning .
on Tuesday morning it would be possible for me from ten $ A- $ M
this would be perfect , I am free until two $ P- $ M
would that suit you ?
yes , this would be suitable for me .
we would meet shortly after ten $ A- $ M on Tuesday .
all right , shortly after ten .
hello .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X ,
I would like to meet you to prepare a trip .
my name is von Sudniz , $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z ,
this is all right with me , too .
let me just make a suggestion
what about November , on Wednesday the third of November ?
I am already booked on Wednesday the third of November , but we could take the Friday of the same week .
would that suit you ?
Friday ?
on Friday I am the whole day free .
me , too .
let us meet on that Friday then .
at eleven in the morning ?
I would be free from ten $ A- $ M
eleven $ A- $ M would be great .

my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
I also need this date with you .
when would it suit you best ?
in October I will not be free for five days in a row .
the end of November would be suitable for me
would you have time then ?
I will not have time before the twenty seventh .
this would be possible , too .
from the twenty seventh of November to the first of December
this is okay with me , I am also free then .
could we fix this ?
from the twenty seventh of November till the first of December .
all right , let us fix this .
all right .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I call you because of a date for a business meal on a Sunday in November .
when would you have time ?
hello .
this is Quell speaking , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
November looks good for me .
I would be free the fourteenth of November .
I could offer you the two following Sundays , too , though .
I am booked on the fourteenth
but the twenty first of November would suit me fine .
can we fix this date then ?
okay , let us have our business meal on the twenty first .
hello .
this is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
I call for a short conference
hello .
this is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
for a short conference I would have time on Tuesday
let us say from eleven to twelve $ A- $ M
Tuesday I am totally free
we would have more time than a hour
if it does not work and we have not agreed yet
let us fix this date .
okay , we will meet on Tuesday at ten $ A- $ M
ten $ A- $ M . okay .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
and I wanted to ask for a date when we could get together to prepare a trip .
hello .
this is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
shall we make it this week or not before November ?
I would prefer to make it as soon as possible .
would you still be free some time during this week ?
yes , I do have time this week .
I would suggest Thursday , as I will be free the whole day .
what time would you propose ?
in the morning would be convenient for me .
let us say nine $ A- $ M
we would have the whole morning then .
let us fix this date then .
at nine $ A- $ M , and the location ?
let us say at my place .
let us meet at my place at nine $ A- $ M
goodbye .
hello .
this is J &quot; ansch speaking , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
who am I talking to , please ?
this is K &quot; opp .
how exactly ?
it is spelled $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
we still wanted to meet for five days ,
if possible during the next two month ,
for a five day business trip to Hannover .
when would you be free ?
yes , you are right , I almost forgot .
as I already know that you are not free in the third week of July , I would suggest to take the fourth week ,
from the twenty sixth .
this does not suit me .
on the twenty sixth and on the twenty seventh I have two hard dates .
I can only make it in August .
I am not free in the beginning of August .
would you be free from the twenty seventh ?
because I would still have a lot of time till August .
what , the twenty seventh of July ?
yes , twenty seventh , twenty eighth , twenty ninth , thirtieth and thirty first .
these are exactly five days and the Saturday , we can work then , too , that is nothing special .
no , on the twenty seventh I will not be free .
from the third of August I am free for five days in a row .
that does not suit me at all .
this is all placed very clever .
I am booked from the third to the eighth .
eleventh and twelfth are bad .
perhaps from the thirteenth I would have five days , although this would include a holiday .
I will be on vacation on this weekend with Assumption day .
no possibility
on the fourteenth for example .
that is impossible , too .
I have to look very thoroughly now .
I see another five days from the twenty fourth of August to the twenty eighth .
unfortunately there is always something in between there .
I think we will have to postpone it to September .
in September , are we allowed to do so ?
it is all right with me , I have no objections .
I would suggest the time from the ninth to the seventeenth .
on the ninth I have a short meeting , though
we could not meet then before the afternoon or the evening .
but after that I would be free till the seventeenth .
great
then I would suggest to forget the ninth and start at the tenth .
this would include a weekend but I think this should not disturb us .
let us work over the weekend and we will meet on Friday the tenth in the lobby of the Parkhotel close to the station in Hannover .
and then we will stay there for five days .
is this all right ?
yes , that is all right .
goodbye
goodbye
this is G &quot; urtner speaking .
we wanted to
G &quot; urtner is spelled like this , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
we still wanted to meet for a business dinner on a Sunday .
when would you be free ?
hello , Mr G &quot; urtner
this is Walberg speaking , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
in August on a Sunday
I could offer two Sundays
this is the twelfth of September and the twenty sixth of September
oh dear
I have just noticed that we are talking about August .
let me check this again .
the first would be free and the fifteenth
on the first I will be on vacation with my family for an extended weekend .
on the fifteenth I am not available either , because I will be on vacation , too , for the extended weekend .
the twenty second would suit me and the twenty ninth and the one before , the eighth , too .
I have just noticed that the date on the twenty ninth is crossed out , I failed to see that .
I would be free on the twenty ninth .
all the other days do not suit me either .
I would suggest to meet on the twenty ninth then for a nice little business dinner with some lobster and some shrimps ,
or whatever ,
and talk a little about vowel perception .
okay , that is all right with me .
our secretaries have to choose the place and the exact time then .
okay , goodbye .
goodbye
hello .
this is Niehmeyer speaking , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
I would like to meet you during the next week , till the eighth .
when would you be free ?
hello .
this is Quell speaking , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
yes . you are right , we wanted to meet .
today is Thursday and tomorrow is Friday .
I would suggest the next two days .
would that suit you ?
I think , that we have already found a very good day .
today , let me check if this is possible .
all right .
let us take Thursday then .
I am only free until two $ P- $ M though , it has to be earlier .
as it is ten $ A- $ M already , I would suggest to meet right after lunch ,
around twelve thirty .
this is rather short notice .
I would
no , okay , let us leave it at that .
this has to be a short meeting then .
I would suggest twelve thirty ,
we will have a good hour and if we exceed I still can leave before two $ P- $ M
I would suggest to fix twelve thirty .
okay , I agree .
I will just have enough time for lunch , but okay .
okay , thanks a lot .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
this is von Sudniz speaking , $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
we still wanted to meet before we go on on the trip .
we still have to talk about some matters and have to prepare things .
when would you have time ?
I think it should take place some time during the next two weeks .
this is Flex speaking , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I did not really understand your name but I think that we should get together in any case .
this is an arbitrary date
and I do not know how much time it will take
do you have an idea ?
I think that two hours will be sufficient for a detailed talk
okay , let us start and not waste too much time .
I am booked on Friday .
what about Saturday , Sunday , third and fourth ?
I would rather avoid a weekend .
what about the fifth of July ?
that is a Monday .
that is impossible , I will be on an important business trip to D &quot; usseldorf then .
but I would again be free on Tuesday , if necessary on Wednesday and Thursday , too .
no ,
this does not suit me as I will be in Hamburg then , until the ninth ,
this is the Friday , and the following Monday .
but we must have met before the eighth .
let us look closer for a day on which we could meet .
okay , then what do you think about tomorrow , Friday ?
I am totally booked from nine $ A- $ M to eight $ P- $ M ,
unless we meet before nine $ A- $ M but this is not in the plans .
if this is the case , the last possibility will be the Saturday .
I would suggest to meet for breakfast in the city .
it is a weekend after all .
that is all right with me , I can do some shopping then , too .
I have no further plans for Saturday .
I do not have any appointments written down either .
I would say at nine $ A- $ M
and where ?
nine $ A- $ M here in Munich on the Marienplatz at the subway station .
what do you think ?
I agree that is all right with me .
see you on Saturday the third at nine $ A- $ M at the subway station .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
my name is von Sudniz , it is spelled $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking ?
the name is spelled as follows , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H
I was told that we are supposed to go on a five day business trip to Hannover together .
I have been told so , too
we only have to find some days now .
Mr J &quot; ansch , what would you think of September ?
I would be free from the first , this is a Wednesday , to the fifth , this is a Sunday .
would that suit you ?
very bad , Mr Sudniz
I have some appointments then , you know , and I think we should make it earlier .
I suggest in July , from the twentieth to the twenty fourth .
what do you think about that ?
yes ,
Mr J &quot; ansch ,
I really would like to ,
but it is my daughter &apos; s birthday then , this is on the twenty second in Augsburg , and I have to go to the party .
this will not be possible .
I would like to get back to July ,
if this is what suits you best , from the fourteenth , a Wednesday ,
to Monday the nineteenth .
what about that ?
well , Mr Sudniz , I will be in new York then .
you know the business , do not you ?
but what about the end of July , from the twenty seventh to the thirty first ?
that should be possible .
yes , Mr J &quot; ansch , we somehow cannot come to an agreement here .
no ,
on the twenty ninth from ten $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M I have a very important date with my manager ,
it would be impossible to cancel that .
I get back to September again
from Friday the tenth to Sunday the nineteenth I am absolutely free .
these are my vacations but we can make whatever we want then .
please choose five days in a row from Friday the tenth till Sunday the nineteenth
these are my vacations , too , but we can agree upon that .
what about the tenth to the fourteenth ?
you mean from the tenth to the fourteenth ?
this suits me fine .
I will see you on the tenth then , I would suggest at nine thirty $ A- $ M at the airport to Hannover .
okay ?
excellent .
see you then , goodbye .
hello .
my name is Walberg .
it is spelled $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G
with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking ?
Mr Walberg , it is nice to finally have you on the phone .
my name is $ Q $ U $ E and double $ L .
Mr Walberg , it is about a business meal
we finally agreed on a day and we should celebrate this with champagne and caviar
I suggest to make it on a Sunday in August .
which day would be convenient for you ?
very difficult
I am very busy , you know , but I have just noticed Sunday the twenty sixth .
this would be nice .
what do you think ?
Mr Walberg , I have got a problem
in my calendar the twenty sixth is a Thursday .
I do not know if you have an old calendar in front of you .
we are talking about August .
sure .
the business , you know , I am totally confused .
in August , sure .
what about the twenty ninth , for example ?
what do you think about that ?
great , in fact I am free then .
one of the few Sundays
Sunday the twenty ninth , I write this down .
I will inform my secretary .
see you then , goodbye .
hello .
my name is K &quot; opp .
am I talking to the publishing director of Siemens ?
K &quot; opp is spelled $ K $ &quot; O double $ P .
correct .
my name is J &quot; urgen Niehmeyer .
it is spelled as follows , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
what can I do for you ?
Mr Niehmeyer , the matter is as follows .
I have finally got you on the phone .
we have to make an appointment at short notice .
it would suit me fine ,
if we could plan this for this week still , today is Thursday , the weekend or beginning of next week .
I would be totally free
let me just have a look in my diary .
what about Friday ?
I would be free the whole day then .
what do you think about Friday the second ?
pretty bad .
I am never in on Fridays
you can mark this , I am never in on Fridays
what about today ?
as you know it is nine o &apos;clock in the morning now .
my suggestion is three $ P- $ M
what do you think about that ?
no , three $ P- $ M is too late for me .
from two to seven $ P- $ M I have a quite important meeting with our chairman of the Board , it is impossible to cancel that .
now it is a quarter past eleven $ A- $ M , so we could meet right now .
I would be free till two $ P- $ M
still have some important business to do
at one $ P- $ M , would it suit you at one $ P- $ M ?
I think the time from one to two $ P- $ M will be sufficient for a short meeting .
I will come to your place in a while .
let us meet downstairs in the canteen and talk about it during lunch .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .
I have finally got you on the phone , this took a while
this certainly is Mr Flex , it is spelled $ F $ L $ E $ X .
as you know ,
we have to go on a long trip together and I think it would be nice to talk about it before .
what do you think about meeting next Tuesday ?
this would be the sixth of July .
let us do the whole thing again .
Mr Flex , can you hear me ?
the connection has been interrupted for a moment .
I do understand you again .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I do also think that it is important to meet each other .
I have no time at all then , though .
no , this cannot be canceled at all .
I will go to Hamburg to the theater .
what do you think about Sunday the tenth ?
it would suit me fine .
as you know ,
we are already leaving for the $ U . $ S . $ A . on Sunday the eleventh and we really should study this subject in detail .
then I would suggest to meet on Wednesday the seventh .
would that be possible for you ?
I will be in Hamburg then that is from Tuesday to Friday .
it is impossible for me on Wednesday .
but let us make it a little bit earlier , Mr Flex .
what do you think about Saturday ?
I will be free the whole Saturday .
as you know , I am always working very hard during the week , that is why I always took Saturday off .
but I would certainly make an exception for you .
I would prefer Saturday mornings , if this would suit you .
I give a party on Friday night .
to be honest with you , the Saturday morning would not suit me at all .
in the evening I will go to the theater .
let me invite you .
first we will go to the Kammerspiele and we will talk about the whole thing while having dinner .
what do you think , Saturday evening at eight o &apos;clock ?
excellent , Mr G &quot; urtler .
I would suggest to meet on Saturday in front of the Kammerspiele at seven $ P- $ M
shall I order a ticket for you , too ?
yes , gladly .
see you then .
okay , I will see you on Saturday in the evening .
see you then , goodbye .

Mr G &quot; urtner , I say hello to you .
my name is spelled $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
you want to go in the beginning of January already ?
this does not really suit me .
what do you think of the third week of January ?
pretty bad .
as you know , the trip is planned to take five days and I am not free till the end of January .
could we advance it a little bit to Friday the fifteenth of January to Wednesday the twentieth ?
this is bad for me , as I will be in L &quot; ubeck on the eighteenth and on the nineteenth .
this is difficult
what shall we do ?
the last chance we have is in the end of January possibly , from the twenty seventh to the thirty first .
what about that ?
Friday is already marked .
perhaps we should nevertheless make it in the first week
would it be possible for you to go over the holidays ?
on Epiphany ?
yes I could do that .
I actually wanted to go skiing then , but I have to cancel it .
why do not we go from the fifth to the tenth ?
I possibly can also arrange to be free then .
we should fix this date .
shall we leave it at that ?
I would say that I will meet you at the airport then .
I will get the tickets .
see you then , goodbye .
hello .
this is Walberg speaking , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I should make this appointment with you for the business meal .

it is spelled $ Q $ U $ E double $ L .
when could we make it ?

Saturday the thirteenth does not suit me , as I am already booked then .
what about the following Saturday , the twenty first ?

the first day of spring , excellent .
why not ?
we could sit outside then and talk about it in a social gathering .
yes , we can fix this right now , eight $ P- $ M ?
okay , I will take care of the reservations .
in the restaurant where we usually talk about such things ?
as usual , I would say .
at eight $ P- $ M as well ?
eight $ P- $ M , all right ; I am looking forward to it .
see you then , goodbye

hello .
my name is K &quot; opp , department three .

by the way you are talking to Mrs Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
would it suit you for lunch ?
we could go to the canteen together and talk about it along with the meal .
yes , this would suit me .
we save time again and can get over with it quickly .
let us simply meet in the canteen for lunch .
what time would suit you ?

let us get back to our date .
Thursday morning does not suit you ?
not at all .
I am very busy , as you know .
why do not we put this off to Wednesday ?
how do you feel about that ?
Wednesday morning ?
would it suit you some time between nine $ A- $ M and one $ P- $ M ?
some time is impossible for me .
why not simply say at nine $ A- $ M ?
we can arrange this right in the morning and you will again be free after half an hour .

my name is spelled $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R
let us go back to the appointment
the first three days are fine but on the fourth we are already booked

I will see you then

my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R ,
and I am booked during the time you proposed .
I would suggest the time from the fourth to the eighth of February .
does this suit you ?
I am sorry , but I am booked then .
my second suggestion is Tuesday the second of March to Saturday the sixth of March .
I am sorry , but I am again already booked during this period of time .
but I could go to Saarbr &quot; ucken in the week from the eighth to the thirteenth of March .
I am very sorry , but this time I will be on a business trip again .
I could only suggest the twenty first , Thursday the twenty first of January to Tuesday the twenty sixth of January .
what about the week from Wednesday the thirteenth to the seventeenth of January ?
that would be all right , if we could meet towards the evening of the thirteenth as I have an appointment until noon .
but if we could meet in Saarbr &quot; ucken in the evening at seven $ P- $ M and start the seminar then , it would be all right with me .
yes , this suggestion is all right with me .
okay , we will meet on Wednesday the thirteenth of January at seven $ P- $ M in the Hotel in Saarbr &quot; ucken .
thank you and goodbye
goodbye .
hello .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .

I would suggest to meet on Tuesday the nineteenth of January around four thirty $ P- $ M
hello .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
on the nineteenth of January I am already booked , unfortunately .
please make another suggestion for the week before .
during the week before I am out of town on Monday and Tuesday , Thursday would possibly suit me .

yes , Thursday at two $ P- $ M is all right with me .
okay , I have marked that , thank you , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello .

I would like to arrange a five day working session in W &quot; urzburg with you .
hello .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
when would you have time , Mr J &quot; ansch ?
it would suit me best in the end of October .
the end of October ?
no , the twenty ninth is too late for me , unfortunately .
can not we make it earlier ?
I would be free on the twenty fifth and on the twenty seventh .
the twenty fifth and the twenty seventh are only three days .
we should meet for five days though .
when would you be free on the twenty fifth ?
I would be free from the twenty second to the thirtieth or even to the thirty first .
I would be free from the twenty second to the twenty eighth ,
except for the twenty sixth from eleven thirty $ A- $ M to one . $ P- $ M and for the twenty eighth from three $ P- $ M to nine $ P- $ M
what do you think about November ?
it would suit me from the first to the fifth .
unfortunately I am already booked then .
and later on ?
then not before the twelfth .
no , I am sorry I have already arranged an appointment then .
let us make it in the end of October and try to find a solution for the hours you are already booked .
okay , all right .
okay , thank you very much .
I thank you , too .
hello .
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L ,
I would like to make an appointment with you on a Sunday in November for a business meal .
hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
when would you have time in November ?
it would suit me on the fourteenth , twenty first and twenty eighth .
the twenty first is Veterans-Day
what about the twenty eighth of November ?
the twenty eighth would suit me , too
great .
thank you and goodbye .
hello .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
I would like to make an appointment with you towards the end of this week or the beginning of next week for a short conference .
hello .
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P
when would it suit you , Mr Niehmeyer ?
theoretically I would be free for the rest of this week , except for Thursday afternoon .
that is bad because I am busy on Thursday .
what about the beginning of next week ?
in the beginning of next week I would be free , too .
when would you have time ?
in the morning of both , Monday and Tuesday .
let us fix Monday morning at nine o &apos;clock .
yes , that is okay with me .
all right
see you on Monday .
thank you .
thanks
hello .
my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I would like to make an appointment with you to prepare our trip .
would you be free in the end of November ?
hello .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
the end of November would suit me .
when exactly would you have time then ?
what about Thursday afternoon , the twenty fifth of November ?
on Thursday afternoon I will not be in .
I will be here from Friday to Sunday .
let us fix the date for Saturday morning .
yes , that is all right with me .
shall we say at ten $ A- $ M ?
yes , great , thank you very much .
thank you and goodbye .
yes , great , then let us fix a date .
when would it suit you ?
well , I thought next week , in any case still in April .
yes , on Tuesday the sixth of April I am still free , but only in the afternoon .
is that possible for you , too ?
oh , that is bad , I have a dentist &apos; s appointment at two thirty $ P- $ M then .
but Thursday morning around nine would suit me .
is that April the eighth ?
oh , I actually meant April the fifteenth , one week later .
that is Thursday after Easter , I will still be on holiday then , in Majorca .
I must say I would prefer if we postponed the whole thing until May .
is that possible for you , too ?
in the first week of May , all afternoons are still free in my calendar , from about two o &apos;clock $ P- $ M on .
fine .
shall we do it as early as on Monday the third of May ?
perhaps at half past three ?
oh , half past three is actually too late for me , I am already off then .
can not we agree on half past two then ?
that will be a bit tight for me .
let us rather say a quarter to three .
yes .
a quarter to three is okay for me , too .
where shall we meet ?
is it possible at your place ?
yes .
you will come to my office then .
okay , all right .
then I summarize .
on Monday the third of April , no , stop , that was May , otherwise
so on the third of my at a quarter to three you will come to my office .
okay .
fine .
see you then , bye .
fine , great , then let us fix a date .
when would it suit you ?
how about Tuesday the thirteenth of April in the morning ?
I am sorry but on the thirteenth of April I will still be on holiday , just as on the twelfth of April .
I will not be free before the fourteenth of April .
the fourteenth if a Wednesday , right ?
yes , exactly .
however , I have already got a doctor &apos; s appointment from nine to ten o &apos;clock then .
therefore I would , perhaps , suggest Thursday .
that is not possible because I have already got a meeting for PhD students from ten to two o &apos;clock .
can you repeat that ?
yes , I said that on Thursday the fifteenth of April I have got a meeting for PhD students from ten to two o &apos;clock .
anyway , I am almost never free on Thursday .
how about meeting on Monday instead , on Monday afternoon or some time in the early morning ?
which Monday do you mean ?
how about on the twelve ?
on Monday the twelfth of April I am already booked , that means I will still be on holiday then .
the fifth is bad , too ,
but on April the sixth ,
that is a Tuesday ,
I am still free the whole day .
shit .
unfortunately I will be away on April the sixth .
how about making an exception and trying it on Saturday ?
on Saturday the tenth .
yes , Saturday the tenth of April , if we try it right in the morning , not a bad suggestion .
how about eight thirty ?
oh , not before nine on Saturdays , please .
fine , make a suggestion .
okay , see you then .
bye .
the date we agreed upon recently , the tenth , on Saturday , that is not possible for me after all .
we should fix another one .
when I am looking at my calendar , that looks bad .
I can offer you Tuesday the sixth of April or Friday the sixteenth of April .
when does it suit you best ?
anything before four o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
then I would say it is best directly after lunch , at two o &apos;clock $ P- $ M , here in this room , too .
fine , great , thanks a lot , then that is no problem .
see you then .
bye .
yes , fine , Mr Scheytt , then we should perhaps arrange a meeting .
shall we fix another date in March or when does it suit you best ?
yes , I do think we should meet as early as in March .
I would suggest on April the sixteenth .
rubbish , I mean March , of course .
that is a Tuesday , is not it ?
right , that is a Tuesday .
how about Tuesday afternoon at a quarter to four after the lecture ?
I only have one lecture on Tuesday , namely in the morning , but Tuesday afternoon is good .
if the afternoon is a little inconvenient for you we can as well make it earlier .
I also have another lecture from nine to twelve o &apos;clock .
if we perhaps want to try it afterwards ?
we could also meet for lunch .
with pleasure , great . in the cafeteria or shall we choose a nicer atmosphere ?
it is a little loud in the cafeteria .
let us go to the Greek restaurant .
okay , then I repeat Tuesday the ninth of March at half past twelve it the Greek restaurant .
okay , let us keep that .
yes , Mrs Petz , then let us fix a date .
yes , Mr Scheytt , I would say the second week in October .
how about you ?
in the second week in October it is only possible for me on Monday and Tuesday because from Wednesday onwards I will be at a conference in Berlin .
well , Monday seems bad for me , I have already got appointments the whole day through .
how about Tuesday morning at ten ?
Tuesday at ten is bad again for me because I will still be at my sports training then .
I think we should postpone the whole business to the week after .
is that possible for you ?
but then it would only be possible for me on Friday because I will be in Washington the whole week .
how about Friday ?
Friday is basically not bad at all , in the afternoon at a quarter to three .
yes , fine .
a quarter to three , we can do that .
so it is Friday the twenty third of October , a quarter to three here at my place ?
if you could just briefly explain to me how to get to your place . no problem for me .
okay . well , I think you know your way around Karlsruhe . am I right ?
yes , you are .
do you know the university of Karlsruhe , the information science building ?
yes , I am sure I will find my way there .
that is quite simple . you ask for the botanic garden and then come over to the building through the pheasants garden .
you will find me on the second floor in room two hundred and three .
fine , then let us do it like that .
so that was Friday the twenty third of October , two forty five $ P- $ M . okay . see you then . bye .
yes , great , Mr Scheytt , I also like that .
I will tell my secretary immediately .
if I should not be there just wait for me for five minutes . see you then .
bye .
yes , Mr Mohr , when shall we meet again in the month of March ?
yes , Mr Kowalski , how about the first week in March ?
as for me , I still have not got any dates then .
yes ,
that is a good coincidence .
I have not got any major things planned for the first week in March , too , and so we could have our date in the first week between Monday the first and Friday the fifth .
yes , then I would say that we meet in the middle of the week .
Wednesday the third of March at eleven o &apos;clock .
eleven o &apos;clock , that is very convenient for me , shortly before lunch .
yes , and if our meeting lasts longer we can also have lunch together .
can you suggest a certain restaurant for lunch ?
yes , I have heard that in the university canteen there is always a nice selection of different food for lunch .
that sounds great .
I think we will do that .
fine .
so see you then , Mr Kowalski .
yes , bye .
yes , Mr Mohr , our meeting in March was very successful .
when shall we fix a date for the month of May ?
I think we should meet in April .
May is still some time away and I think we should take April before .
okay .
so a date for the month of April .
when does it suit you best ?
yes , in the first week in April I could offer you Friday the second .
well ,
Friday the second does not suit me at all ,
I will be off then so you can not find me at work .
okay . we could of course also meet on Friday afterwards , the ninth ,
in the morning or until four o &apos;clock in the afternoon .
when would it suit you ?
well , the month of April is quite booked with appointments for me .
even on Friday the ninth I have got a seminar the whole day .
as an alternative I could offer Tuesday the sixth of April .
yes , now I am sorry .
on Tuesday the sixth of April I will be away the whole day , and so it is not possible to meet then .
I could suggest the twentieth or the twenty first of April .
the twentieth or twenty first of April would basically be possible but I still do not now what my plans for that month will be and so I would suggest to have our meeting in the first week in April .
yes , in the first week of April it is rather bad .
so there is only the first or second left for us .
would you be prepared to work at the weekend ?
well , at the weekend ,
we in leading positions in our companies must , of course , also make concessions and be able to meet at the weekend or on Sunday or at any time .
there is the right atmosphere . we could meet for a casual tennis match and then exchange our results .
so let us meet on Saturday the third of April at two $ P- $ M on the tennis court .
so it is Saturday third of April ,
two $ P- $ M ,
shortly before the sports magazine .
simple great ,
the date .
we will do that .
yes , great that we have found something in April after all .
so goodbye now , Mr Kowalski .
yes , okay .
bye now .
now , Mr Mohr , the idea with the tennis court last month , the idea was simply great .
I would suggest we will do something like that this month , too , in May .
how about you ?
I also find it quite nice that we had our meeting while we were doing sports but I do think that we should go to normal working days and keep the weekend for the family .
what about a meeting on Monday ?
on Monday it is for me in May like that that I am on holiday in the first two weeks ,
that means you can not reach me until Sunday the fifteenth , no , Saturday the fifteenth of March .
yes ,
Mr Kowalski ,
Mondays are quite bad for me ,
once I have got a meeting that lasts the whole day , and on the other day I must go shopping for a birthday .
yes ,
that is a pity , but the only days possible for me would perhaps be Thursday the twentieth of May when I would be free in the afternoon .
how is that for you ?
yes , that suits me perfectly .
then I would say let us meet on Thursday the twentieth of May at your place and discuss everything else .
I would suggest a time shortly after lunch .
would it suit you at , well , let us say two $ P- $ M , two thirty ?
yes , two , two thirty suits me , I can have my other appointments before then .
and then we will meet in your office .
bye .
fine , I will tell my secretary .
see you on Thursday the twentieth of May , two $ P- $ M . bye .
we should fix an appointment .
which date would you suggest ?
yes , the fourth would suit me .
the fourth is a bit bad .
what time would you suggest ?
I would suggest around one o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
I have got a lecture until twelve o &apos;clock and afterwards I would like to have lunch .
how about the tenth of May ?
Monday the tenth of May .
Monday the tenth of May would suit be but it would have to be in the afternoon .
yes , I would suggest three o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
what do you think how long we will need ?
at least two hours .
perhaps even more .
okay , then we would perhaps finish our meeting by six o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
shall we fix this date ?
yes , we can fix this date .
fine , then we still have to fix a date .
yes , fine , when would it suit you ?
in April it is a bit bad for me .
would it be possible on the twentieth ?
yes , on the twentieth I am basically free .
would you prefer the morning or the afternoon ?
the morning would be okay but not before ten o &apos;clock .
I have just remembered that on the twentieth I might have a meeting after all .
perhaps we can find another day .
yes , how about the sixth ?
I would still have quite a lot of time then .
on the sixth of April it is unfortunately not possible for me .
I will be away then .
on the seventh , too .
how about the sixteenth of May ?
oh .
it is my birthday on May the sixteenth .
but I would be free in spite of that .
perhaps in the afternoon .
tenth of April .
oh yes , of course . that was wrong , yes . it was a mistake on my part .
yes , April the sixteenth is good .
I would suggest we meet between nine and one o &apos;clock .
I would suggest perhaps ten o &apos;clock .
that possible .
on April the ninth at ten o &apos;clock .
yes , we can meet here in the information science building in the entrance hall .
I agree to that .
yes , then it would probably be best if we fixed a date .
when does it suit you ?
perhaps still in June ?
yes , in June it would basically be possible for me .
fine . then how about Wednesday the third of June at your place . will you be free then ?
yes , the third is not so good for me .
I would say a date on the seventeenth would not be bad .
but the earliest time possible would be four forty $ P- $ M .
June the seventeenth ?
oh , the former day of the German unity .
no , I have got no time then , I will be visiting my mother .
but how about on the eighteenth , in the afternoon at two thirty ?
on the eighteenth I am unfortunately almost completely booked , and especially at two thirty it would not be possible .
the earliest time possible for me would be four forty $ P- $ M .
yes ,
four forty is not bad . then I would say let us meet on the eighteenth of June at twenty to five at your place .
see you then . bye .
yes , see you then .
yes , then we only have to fix a date for a meeting in July .
fine .
how about Friday the second of June ?
yes , I will be off then and I actually wanted to go to a lake .
well , I would prefer the sixteenth .
the sixteenth is not bad . but I will only be free until four o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
four o &apos;clock $ P- $ M is a little too late for me .
then we should perhaps fix the date earlier .
how about the twenty second , a Thursday ?
that would suit me very well .
yes , on the twenty second I have got a seminar from eight to four o &apos;clock .
but I think you misunderstood me .
on the sixteenth I am only free until four o &apos;clock , not after four o &apos;clock .
until four o &apos;clock I would be free , of course .
I would prefer it in the morning .
fine .
let us say twenty past eleven ?
half past eleven is a straightforward time .
as far as I am concerned at half past eleven then .
see you then , bye .
see you then .
I would like it if we met again in summer .
how is August for you ?
in the first two weeks of August I will be on holiday and apart from that my calendar is quite full .
but perhaps
on Monday the seventeenth I would be free until five o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
on Monday the seventeenth I have only got a meeting from nine till twelve o &apos;clock .
but what do you think about meeting for a business lunch ?
I would like that a lot .
when would be your preferred time ?
at one o &apos;clock ?
yes , one o &apos;clock is not bad .
then we have got two hours before you must leave at three o &apos;clock .
yes , then let us do it like that .
see you then .
bye .
okay , bye .
hello , Mr Dingler .
we still have to fix a date .
have you got your calendar with you ?
hello , Mr Schaaf . yes , my calendar is lying in front of me .
I would prefer it as soon as possible .
next week .
but then I will be away for three days .
next week looks rather full for me .
that probably will not be possible .
yes , could we perhaps try it on Monday the fifteenth ?
between twelve and one approximately .
on the fifteenth I have got a meeting from two to four $ P- $ M .
twelve to one o &apos;clock would be suitable .
okay , then let us do it like that .
hello , Mr Dingler .
do you still remember ?
we have to fix a date .
I would suggest , now that I am looking at my calendar , Tuesday the ninth .
that would suit me .
in the afternoon .
hello , Mr Schaaf .
unfortunately it does not suit me at all on the ninth since I will be away from the ninth till the eleventh .
we must take another date .
would the sixteenth suit you , in the afternoon ?
yes , when in the afternoon ?
in the afternoon between two and four o &apos;clock perhaps .
yes , that should be possible .
where shall we have our meeting then ?
could you reserve a conference room for the sixteenth ?
yes , I will try to reserve one .
okay ,
then I would say March the sixteenth nineteen ninety three ,
a conference room of your choice , three to five o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
it will be done like that .
hello , Mr Schaaf .
as you know we still have to fix a date in May .
since today is already Friday the thirtieth and it is a bit urgent I would suggest that we will have this meeting on Thursday the sixth .
does that Thursday suit you ?
you are lucky that you have met me .
I am going on holiday for the next two weeks .
that means actually that we can not arrange a meeting before May the seventeenth .
May the seventeenth .
that is of course a very late date and that week I am already quite booked .
but I would be free the whole day on the twentieth .
would that be possible for you ?
I have got a meeting then from nine till eleven .
but the evening seems to be free . I could probably arrange that , yes .
well , Mr Schaaf , that is perfect .
then I will reserve a large conference room with all technical equipment for the twentieth from one to five o &apos;clock $ P- $ M and then you will come to me to the institute .
how long will the meeting last ?
considering all possibilities two and a half hours maximum .
we want to take the safe way . I reserve the room for three hours .
hello , Mr Schaaf .
as you know we still need a date for a meeting this month .
well , if it was on the sixteenth in the morning , it would suit me .
that is perfect .
on the sixteenth I am completely free .
I would say we will meet at nine o &apos;clock then .
please decide about the place .
yes , at nine o &apos;clock , then I would suggest we will meet in the little seminar room here on the third floor .
okay , April the sixteenth nineteen ninety three , nine o &apos;clock , seminar room on this floor .
okay . I am looking forward to this date .
bye .
hello , Jochen .
good morning , Holger .
good morning , Holger .
if I am right we still need a date .
are you still free some time in the next two weeks ?
yes , just a moment . today is March the second and you want to fix a date next week .
the week after would also be possible for me .
oh , say that right away .
although that is not much better .
but I would say before the eighth it is too soon .
yes , definitely .
the problem is I will not be here next week between Tuesday and Thursday .
Monday and Friday of that week do not really suit me .
so the eighth or the twelfth .
right .
the question is of course how much time we really need for the date .
I think one and a half hours should be enough .
so long ?
I would have thought that this is done in half an hour .
as far as I am concerned we can also fix half an hour .
in spite of the metaphysical confusions you are afraid of since it takes so long to discuss them .
my horoscope says on Wednesday the stars are in a good position .
I know you can not stay serious , but no matter what we want , Wednesday is completely out of the question .
I guess you mean Wednesday the seventeenth .
yes , I mean that .
at what time do you mean ?
my seminar lasts until half past four and I will not be back before seven and , to be honest , that is too late for me .
yes , I understand that .
but how about Tuesday or Thursday afternoon ?
Thursday afternoon is out of the question ,
Tuesday , if absolutely necessary , yes , although I ,
yes ,
Tuesday afternoon is possible .
or as an alternative Friday afternoon , three o &apos;clock .
well , Friday the nineteenth is not possible but Tuesday afternoon would be quite good for me .
okay .
Tuesday afternoon at three $ P- $ M at your place .
I agree .
okay , see you in a fourtnight then .
yes , I would be happy if we fixed a date then .
when would it suit you ?
yes , I really do not know .
how about in July ?
at the beginning of July I would still have time , at the end of July I will be on holiday .
when would you go on holiday ?
on Saturday the seventeenth of July I wanted to go on holiday .
then we should fix our date before that .
would it be possible in the first week in July ?
yes , let us say Tuesday the sixth of July .
I will still be free then .
Tuesday is a little inconvenient .
could we perhaps make in on Thursday ?
do you mean Thursday the eighth or Thursday the fifteenth of July ?
I would actually prefer Thursday the eighth of July .
then I suggest Thursday the eighth of July at half past three .
could we perhaps have it in the morning ?
I would suggest ten to eleven o &apos;clock .
yes , how about a quarter to eleven ?
do you think that will be enough ?
perhaps we should after all start at ten o &apos;clock ?
oh , I have just remembered something .
at that time I must go to the dentist .
what a pity . can you make another suggestion for a date ?
perhaps Friday the ninth of July ?
that is a bit bad with me . but I could squeeze in a date around eleven .
yes , I think that would be okay with me , too .
shall we do it like that ?
would you like to come to my office ?
yes , we can do it like that .
I will come on Friday at eleven then .
okay .
see you then , bye .
see you then .
hello , Mr Karl . we still have to fix a date .
oh yes , Mr Klein , right .
let me just tell you , next week from Tuesday to Thursday I will not be here , apart from that we will find something .
then it does not seem to be possible next week because I do not have time on Monday and Friday .
fine .
the week after it is not possible at all in the afternoon .
Monday morning ?
if I have time to have lunch before two $ P- $ M , no problem .
but of course .
nine o &apos;clock ?
what do you think how long we will need ?
not more than half an hour .
I have got another date at ten o &apos;clock .
okay then . I will keep that date in mind .
you should better write it down .
oh , hello , Mr Gramlich .
good that I have met you here .
I would like to arrange a date with you for a meeting of the heads of project .
yes , as far as I am concerned we can do that .
the month of July would be best .
which days of the week would you prefer ?
at ten o &apos;clock .
I will be coming from my doctor &apos; s then .
Wednesday would also be okay for me but not before six $ P- $ M , after the lecture .
no , I will be at a meeting then .
how about Friday at four $ P- $ M ?
Friday at four $ P- $ M . it would be better at four thirty .
Friday , four thirty . but I must leave again at eight $ P- $ M .
fine , then let us do it on Friday . eight $ P- $ M we said ?
I will also tell Mr Sch &quot; afer , so that he will be there , too .
bye .
fine , bye .
hello , Mr Schulz .
I would like to arrange a date with you , namely some time in July
since you have stood me up three times already , I would like to get it done quickly now ,
namely on Tuesday at three twenty five $ P- $ M .
well , I am sorry that I have stood you up three times but it really was not possible for me ,
I urgently had to go to a conference to the $ U $ S $ A .
but Tuesday is very bad .
how about another day ?
the only alternative I could offer you is Wednesday , some time between seven and twelve o &apos;clock .
until nine I am away .
it is not possible between seven and nine , no chance .
only from eleven to twelve , but that will be rather tight .
or we will do it on Friday . would that really not be possible ?
yes , so we will have to do it on Wednesday after all , between eleven and twelve .
but that is enough .
about half an hour .
so I would say eleven o &apos;clock .
all right , okay , eleven o &apos;clock in your office .
will you tell the others ?
yes , I will let my secretary do that .
okay .
bye , see you on Wednesday .
bye , Mr Schulz
okay , then let us fix a date .
when would it suit you ?
yes , for me , basically every Monday and every Thursday are possible .
on the Thursday in the first week in June I am already booked .
then how about the Monday after , on the seventh of June ?
so if you could come in the afternoon , that would be okay .
unfortunately I will not be free before Monday evening and I think that will get too late then .
therefore I suggest that we postpone it to Thursday .
Thursday the tenth of June is a bank holiday .
then how about Monday the fourteenth of June .
yes , Monday the fourteenth of June suits me perfectly .
we can take any time you like .
yes , I am free at half past ten in the morning .
okay , fine .
let us meet on Monday the fourteenth of June at ten thirty for our date .
do you want to come to my office ?
that is no problem .
I will come to your office .
fine , my office is in the new information science building , second floor , room two hundred and three .
new information science building , second floor , room two hundred and three .
I have noted it .
Monday the fourteenth of June , ten thirty .
thank you .
fine . see you then .
bye .
bye .
Mr Maier , we should fix a date in March for the presentation .
yes , okay , I agree .
when would it suit you ?
I would prefer the first week of March .
up to now I have not got any dates then .
okay .
would it suit you on Monday ?
normally I never arrange dates for Monday .
but Tuesday would be perfect .
Tuesday morning at eight o &apos;clock in my office .
yes , Tuesday morning at eight in your office would really be good .
but we could also meet at my place .
unfortunately that is not possible because at the moment my car is broken .
so you would have to come to my place .
but then it will be difficult to present all our bestsellers at your place .
so see you on Tuesday .
yes , if there is no alternative we will see each other on Tuesday .
okay .
thank you .
you are welcome .
shall we meet next week in order to go swimming ?
I think that is a good idea .
how about the sixth ?
that is a Thursday .
yes , on the sixth I will still be off , I am actually free the whole day .
when and where shall we meet ?
I would say we will meet directly at the F &quot; acherbad .
but not before the afternoon since it is closed in the morning .
okay , then we can meet there in the afternoon around two o &apos;clock .
okay ?
okay , I am already looking forward to it .
yes , me too .
bye .
take care .
well , I would suggest a date on June the eighteenth .
I have got a lecture until shortly after twelve then .
what would you like ?
yes , I have got a lecture from eleven thirty till one o &apos;clock then , and afterwards I wanted to got to the canteen .
perhaps we could meet at two o &apos;clock then .
no , that is not possible .
we have to take another day .
on the fifteenth perhaps , at ten o &apos;clock .
ten o &apos;clock in the morning .
yes , that seems quite good .
where could we meet then ?
yes , at ten o &apos;clock .
that is not bad .
then we could have the meeting from one to four o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
on the fifteenth .
that would be a Monday , would not it ?
yes , exactly on that Monday .
so bye now , see you then .
bye .
perhaps on Friday the nineteenth of June ?
yes , on June the nineteenth , it would be possible .
would you be free in the morning ?
no , in the morning it is not possible for me .
yes , on the nineteenth in the afternoon , it will be a bit tight for me .
we would have to take another day then .
fine , the I suggest perhaps the ninth . that would be a Tuesday .
I have got a lecture from nine to twelve then .
yes , then perhaps on the Friday after , the twelfth of June ?
yes , great .
there is nothing at all in my calendar then .
then I suggest a date at one $ P- $ M .
we can do that .
so see you then .
bye .
well , it would be good if we fixed a date now to discuss the matter .
yes , I agree .
how about the sixteenth of June ?
unfortunately it is very bad for me on the sixteenth .
I have got lectures the whole day .
can you suggest another ?
yes , perhaps on the twenty fourth ?
that is perhaps not so bad . in the morning or in the afternoon ?
the afternoon would not be bad .
fine , so now we have fixed that afternoon .
bye .
bye .
well , let us fix a date then .
I would suggest June the eighth , at nine o &apos;clock , on Monday .
Monday ? Monday .
ninth of June ?
no , June the ninth is a Tuesday , but that would also be possible for me .
it would also be better for me on Tuesday .
oh , I have just seen that I have no time on Tuesday .
but on that Friday it is not possible for me before five $ P- $ M .
five $ P- $ M is bad .
perhaps on the Monday after , at five $ P- $ M ?
that would be June the fifteenth if I am right ?
yes , that is right , on Monday at five $ P- $ M .
it that okay so far ?
yes , fine , I have taken down five $ P- $ M .
thanks a lot .
then everything is clear . bye .
then everything is clear so far .
then we should fix a date .
I would also like that .
in the middle of July , perhaps on the fourteenth or fifteenth ?
yes , Wednesday the fourteenth of July , that looks quite good .
could we fix a date in the afternoon then ?
unfortunately I have got no time at all in the afternoon .
on the Friday after , perhaps on the sixteenth ?
oh , I am sorry . unfortunately I am going to a conference then . that is not possible for me .
but perhaps the week after ?
unfortunately I will be off the whole week after .
but what if we have it at the beginning of this month ?
perhaps as early as the eighth ?
on Thursday the first of July ?
yes , very nice .
Thursday the first of July at eight o &apos;clock in the morning ?
suits me perfectly .
thanks a lot .
fine , that date suits me , too . bye .
so , now we still need a date .
perhaps at the beginning of August .
yes , I would also like it if we fixed a meeting .
perhaps on the tenth ?
which day of the week is that , please ?
the tenth is a Monday .
yes , Monday the tenth .
I seem to be rather booked then .
if we can arrange a date in the afternoon , very good .
unfortunately I was thinking of the morning .
well , so on Thursday before ?
how about in the afternoon , if you only want the afternoon ?
yes , on that Thursday it would be possible , in the afternoon .
I would suggest three $ P- $ M .
three $ P- $ M , Thursday .
okay .
that is the sixth .
on the sixth of August , three $ P- $ M .
okay , I have noted it .
okay , bye .
bye .
well , then I would like to arrange a date with you .
okay .
I would like April best .
the day does not matter .
fine .
then I suggest Wednesday the fourteenth of April at nine thirty .
will you be free then ?
oh , unfortunately that is not possible at all .
I would like the ninth of April a lot better .
would that perhaps be possible ?
yes , if you make a suggestion for the time ?
yes , it would be best early in the morning .
would that perhaps be possible ?
yes , but not before half past nine , please .
yes , a quarter to nine would suit me perfectly .
great . then let us say a quarter to ten on Friday the ninth of April .
see you then , bye .
yes , and could we also meet , some time in the middle of March ?
yes , as far as I am concerned , with pleasure .
however , I will be away between the ninth of March and the eleventh of March .
when does it suit you best ?
yes , on March the twelfth .
I would be free in the morning .
yes ,
Friday the twelfth of March in the morning is bad because I have got a lecture between nine and eleven o &apos;clock and I am already booked in the afternoon , too .
therefore I would prefer if we took another day .
yes , then on Monday afterwards .
on the fifteenth , perhaps in the morning ?
yes , on March the fifteenth I have got a meeting between ten and twelve .
but we could meet as early as half past eight if that is not too early for you .
that would suit me .
so shall we say the fifteenth of March in the morning at half past eight ?
it would be quite good if we arranged a date in May .
would you be free some time then ?
yes , at the beginning of May I will not be here but from the middle of May onwards it would suit me .
yes , then I suggest Friday the thirteenth of May .
does that suit you ?
no .
that is not possible at all .
but it would still be possible on May the fifteenth .
does that perhaps suit you ?
unfortunately not , there will be a works committee meeting then .
how about two days later , on March the seventeenth ?
is that possible for you ?
it would only be possible in the morning then .
I would still be free between eight and ten .
yes , half past nine would suit me , too .
then there would only rest half an hour before my next date .
would not it be possible a little earlier ?
then I would suggest that we meet as early as eight o &apos;clock .
okay .
eight o &apos;clock sharp at my place . okay .
bye .
see you then .
bye .
yes , then we should meet again some time in March .
when would it be possible ?
yes , in the first week of May I will still be on holiday .
but we could start as early as in the second week of March , on March the eighth .
that probably would not be so good .
would it perhaps be possible on March the ninth , in the afternoon ?
on Tuesday .
no , I will already be away then , I am sorry .
yes , then I can offer Wednesday .
I would be free from eight to twelve without a break .
sorry , but I will be away on Wednesday .
on Thursday , too .
therefore I would suggest that we perhaps got to March the sixteenth , that is a Tuesday .
I have got a lecture then from nine to twelve .
but it would be possible in the afternoon .
great , that suits me . let us say as early as two thirty , after lunch ?
two thirty , half past two .
okay . that suits me .
right .
bye .
okay , see you then .
bye .
what do you think about meeting again in June ?
yes , it would suit me best at the end of June .
there is still a lot of room in my calendar .
that sounds promising .
how about Monday the twenty sixth of June at your place ?
oh , on Monday of all days I have always got a lecture . that is not so good .
it would suit me better on Tuesday .
the morning is bad for me but would it suit you in the afternoon ?
yes , I would be free from about half past two on .
how about that ?
half past two is a little early for me .
I would perhaps suggest a quarter to four .
okay , a quarter to four . suits me . okay .
bye .
see you then .
bye .
yes , Mr Schidewski , then we will need an appointment in the next two weeks .
I agree .
make a suggestion .
what do you think how long we will need ?
certainly one or two hours for the meeting .
next week it is only possible on Monday or Friday .
on Friday I have got no time , Monday is a little early .
then it will have to be the week after , after all . how about Wednesday the seventeenth ?
there will be a seminar where I will be , from nine to four thirty .
that is too late .
Monday morning ?
maybe very early , from eight to ten .
Monday , eight o &apos;clock ?
Thursday afternoon ?
that is very tight .
after half past four .
no , that is again too late .
Tuesday afternoon ?
suits me .
fine , Tuesday the sixteenth , two thirty ?
fine , then we just have to fix the place .
I will come to your office .
okay , see you on Tuesday then .
good morning , Mr Karl .
good morning , Mr Schidewski .
what can I do for you ?
in our project , a problem has appeared unexpectedly .
we have to arrange a meeting as early as possible .
yes , of course I am gladly prepared to help you but as soon as possible will still be rather late .
how is the week from the fifth to the ninth for you ?
yes , Tuesday would not be bad . I will be here the whole day .
that is bad luck , I will not be here then .
it would be possible on Monday or Friday .
well , on Monday I could only squeeze you in for a business lunch , but that is certainly very soon .
on Friday I must look after the seminar in our house .
that is very inconvenient .
how about Tuesday the thirteenth in the morning ?
I will be on holiday then .
I thought you wanted a date as soon as possible .
as soon as possible is one thing .
it is your project .
you must know when you want to have an appointment with me .
it seems as if there is only Monday left , a meal together .
well , I do not like discussions over a business meal .
do not you think that will last too long ?
Friday the second would still be possible .
do you really mean I should do without a day off ?
well , there is only Friday or the business meal on Monday left .
make your choice .
then at twelve thirty , business lunch , one hour .
at two , I have got a customer &apos; s appointment .
Monday at two thirty .
I hope there will be enough time .
when ?
twelve thirty .
two thirty is hardly possible .
twelve thirty of course .
directly in the canteen .
okay .
good morning , Mr Schidewski .
I would like to have an appointment with you for a presentation .
good morning , Mr Karl . with pleasure .
when would you have time ?
I think we should take rather a lot of time . how about Tuesday the twentieth ?
this date seems to be a bit late in the month .
yes , I will hardly have time earlier to have a look at that .
this statement is a little inexact .
what do you mean with statement . which statement is inexact ?
suggest a date .
the sixth , a Tuesday , would be most convenient .
no , that is out of the question . I will be away then .
at what date within the next two weeks would you be free at all ?
well , I could squeeze you in on Friday the ninth and the sixteenth ,
apart from that perhaps on Monday over lunchtime but only reluctantly .
Friday the sixteenth seems very convenient for me , too .
but then relatively early in the morning , please .
yes , fine .
Friday the sixteenth , let us say at nine o &apos;clock .
I will come to your place .
fine , I will expect you at the main entrance .
fine .
hello , Mr Ciupke . I have heard you want to fix a date with me .
yes , I wanted to ask if you have time for a meeting on Saturday the twenty third .
yes , I have already heard about that and have kept that date free .
what time would suit you ?
since you know that I have got an appointment with Dani in the afternoon I probably would not come before eight or nine o &apos;clock .
that is too late .
how about Monday the twenty fifth ?
Monday the twenty fifth seems to be very bad ,
but I can invite you , too for the afternoon appointment on Saturday instead .
videos about Berlin will be shown then .
I will be there anyway but for our meeting we should keep free the week after .
would you be free some time in the following week ?
as far as the evenings are concerned , only Monday and Wednesday are possible .
at almost any time .
then I would suggest on Wednesday before a quarter to eight , so we could meet around seven .
yes , that would be a good time .
by the way , I hope you have taken down Saturday the eighth of May because your presence is urgently required .
Saturday the eighth of May , I will take that down now .
and then we will see each other on Wednesday .
yes , Wednesday is okay , and now for the exact agenda on Saturday .
the actual beginning is as early as on Friday the seventh in the evening , welcoming ,
and then sports on Saturday morning , and in the evening we need your assistance .
okay , I think I will be free then .
oh , by the way , I hope we will meet each other tonight , too .
I think so .
perhaps a little later than eight o &apos;clock .
in any case I will come on Thursday .
that means your appearance at a quarter to seven for the warming up is unlikely .
I will be there at ten o &apos;clock at the latest .
okay .
now that we have fixed all dates I want to talk about the last one .
Monday the fifteenth of March .
would that be possible for you ?
Monday the fifteenth of March .
that depends how long the exam on Tuesday lasts .
well , I can only wish you luck then , and you can come over again .
see you in a minute .
yes , then I would suggest that we fix a date .
when would it suit you ?
well , for me it is actually best in the middle of September .
basically , I have got some spare hours left then .
make a suggestion .
I would suggest you September the sixteenth , a Thursday .
Thursday the sixteenth of September you say .
that is bad for me .
however , I would still be free on Friday the seventeenth of September .
does that suit you , too ?
let me have a look .
that is my grandmother &apos; s birthday .
that is not possible .
perhaps I could offer you the fifteenth .
Wednesday the fifteenth is not bad .
I would still be free in the afternoon after three .
I have just seen that I will be in a conference until four o &apos;clock .
so we could meet around half past four .
yes , four thirty is not bad .
would you like to come to my office ?
yes , that would be possible .
you would just have to tell me the way there .
no problem .
it is in the new information science building , room number two hundred and three ,
on the second floor .
you will find that .
fine .
then we will see each other on Wednesday the fifteenth at four thirty $ P- $ M in your office .
fine , see you then .
bye .
have a nice day .
bye .
I am sorry I have to bother you again .
I need an appointment with you .
yes , hello , okay .
then I must take out my calendar .
mhm , in May .
how about the sixth of May ?
you could not have picked any worse dates than the sixth of May .
I will be on holiday then .
I would prefer the end of May .
the end of May .
oh , I have got lots of appointments then .
the twenty fourth is a bank holiday .
on the twenty sixth I have got a meeting at two $ P- $ M .
how about the twenty seventh at two $ P- $ M ?
the twenty fourth .
I do have a doctor &apos; s appointment at four $ P- $ M but I do not think it will last so long .
two $ P- $ M is okay .
you misunderstood me .
I said on the twenty seventh .
the twenty fourth is a bank holiday .
of course I also mean the twenty seventh .
on the twenty seventh at two $ P- $ M ?
yes , great , let us fix this date .
oh , it is you again .
yes , I would need an appointment with you in May .
I would suggest the seventeenth .
in May , on the seventeenth , that is a Monday .
oh , I am sorry , I have got a seminar away from here the whole day on the seventeenth .
let us take the day after .
on the eighteenth I will be free from nine to twelve .
we could meet at ten o &apos;clock .
yes , exactly on that day my polo club has an important game away .
how about the day after ?
it would suit me between three and six $ P- $ M .
yes , no , the nineteenth does not really suit me , on Wednesday I do not feel like meeting anybody .
but on the twentieth I would be free the whole day .
let us see .
on the twentieth .
yes , that would be possible .
however , at four $ P- $ M I must bring my Ferrari to the garage , so it is possible before four .
that is not problem , as it happens , I must fetch my twelve cylinder Jaguar then .
then let us meet in the morning at eleven thirty , after breakfast .
yes , that would be great . perhaps we could have a little aperitif in my beach villa near Monaco .
that would be great .
just a moment .
yes , with pleasure .
see you then .
oh , hello .
good that I have met you .
I just wanted to send you an email letter , we must urgently meet next week .
that would be from the twelfth to the sixteenth .
let us see .
yes , on the thirteenth it is very bad because of the bad vibrations .
but on the fourteenth at nine I think it would be possible .
no , unfortunately that is bad , I have got a meeting with my colleagues the whole morning .
let us take the day after .
how about nine o &apos;clock ?
oh , nine o &apos;clock , that is very bad .
my men &apos; s self experience group will start then .
how about five $ P- $ M ?
now I have forgotten on which day we are at the moment .
what day are we talking about at the moment ?
was not it April the fourteenth ?
no , no , we already had the fourteenth . it was not possible for you .
on the fifteenth .
oh , I have got a seminar the whole day .
but then perhaps on Friday the sixteenth .
I must go home at four $ P- $ M then .
let us meet after lunch at two $ P- $ M .
yes , after lunch .
that is great .
let us meet then .
oh , hello Holger , now I have finally managed to reach you .
how are things , where are you at the moment ?
at the phone obviously .
but we still need a date , as far as I know .
fine , when would it suit you , for example ?
what date ?
although that might be at too short notice .
I do not really like that .
how about in May ?
in May ?
yes , dear Holger , why not ?
May is still three months away .
it will have to be a little earlier .
well , I have gone through my calendar and found March .
how about that ?
in March only in the tenth week , but I really do not like it .
yes , we could agree about that .
how about the ninth ?
if absolutely necessary , yes .
but I would prefer the end of February .
that does not really suit me . it will be carnival then .
then perhaps on the first of March ?
that is totally out of the question .
it would be better in the tenth week after all , perhaps on the ninth .
now that I am thinking about it I would prefer Saturday .
which Saturday ?
the sixth or the thirteenth ?
yes , the thirteenth is okay .
at what time ?
at seven o &apos;clock in the morning ?
of course .
but I will not be there before nine .
okay .
let us agree on eight o &apos;clock sharp .
okay , see you then .
hello , Mr Meier .
could we fix our date now ?
hello , Mr M &quot; uller .
we have already talked to each other and thought about a date at the end of April or beginning of May .
would you be free then ?
yes , of course , we could do that .
how about on Thursday the twenty ninth of April , if possible in the morning ?
the twenty ninth is a little bad .
we will have festivities on the first or May , and therefore it would be possible either from the twenty sixth to the twenty eighth or afterwards ,
from the third to the sixth .
well , I would only be free on Tuesday morning from eight to nine .
that would be on the twenty seventh of April .
yes , Tuesday morning .
that is possible .
fine .
then we will meet on Tuesday morning at eight o &apos;clock on the twenty seventh of April .
do you think that one hour will be enough or should we fix another date one week later ?
the week after , that is on Tuesday the fourth of May , it would be convenient at eight o &apos;clock .
then we could have an hour more , or , if you have got more time , even a little longer .
oh , that would be the fourth of May , yes .
unfortunately I will be free only for one hour in the morning .
it would be better around lunchtime or on Wednesday morning .
in any case , I would have more time then .
around lunchtime is a good idea .
we could surely arrange something for lunch then .
do you have an idea . ?
so ,
as far as I am concerned , we could meet on Wednesday at half past twelve for lunch and talk about everything afterwards , from half past one to four .
yes , that is okay .
then we will meet on Tuesday the twenty seventh for one hour and on Wednesday the fifth at half past twelve and do what we did not manage to do on Tuesday .
yes , that would be everything on my part .
okay .
so bye then . see you on Tuesday .
yes , bye .
hello , Mr Frank , we wanted to fix a date for our visit to the pigs breeding farm .
it would suit me on Friday the ninth .
does that suit you ?
Friday is extremely bad . I will be in a seminar the whole day .
but how about Tuesday the sixth ?
unfortunately that is not possible , I will be away the whole day .
I am sorry , I will be on holiday then .
perhaps on the coming Friday , on the sixteenth ?
if we finish by three $ P- $ M , of course .
but afterwards I want to go home .
until three $ P- $ M should be enough .
we do not have to look at each individual pig .
okay , see you next Friday .
hello , Heiko .
I would need you again for a meeting on the suitability of a new secretary .
how about the seventeenth for example ?
yes , what time would suit you ?
I have got a meeting at nine but afterwards I would be free .
but I must be finished by three because I will be going swimming then .
so I would suggest to meet at eleven .
tell me if that suits you .
eleven is a great time , that will be exactly enough .
oh , hello . it is good that I have met you .
we must still fix a date .
have you got a calendar with you ?
yes , wait a second .
okay .
would it suit you in August ?
at the end of August ?
August is a bit early I think .
perhaps we will not be quite finished by then .
I would actually prefer the middle of September .
in the first week I would only be free on Monday evening or Wednesday .
we could also go to the second week and fix a date from Tuesday to Thursday around lunchtime .
just a moment .
on Thursday the sixteenth I have already got an appointment .
so we would have to take Wednesday , whether we want to or not .
yes , wait a moment . Wednesday afterwards would be even better .
Wednesday the twenty second .
yes , to be honest , the week after would also suit me , it would suit me even better .
wait a second .
yes , yes , that should be possible .
shall we meet around lunchtime ?
yes , I suggest around two $ P- $ M .
what do you think of that ?
yes , two $ P- $ M should be possible .
will you come to my place ?
yes , I would come to your place .
okay . then let us fix that date and talk to each other over the phone before then .
yes , okay . I like that .
well , Mr Schr &quot; oder , then I would say that we perhaps fix a date .
would you still be free in December , some time ?
yes , I must have a look .
well , the first two weeks are quite booked .
how about Thursday the seventeenth of December at eight thirty ?
the seventeenth of December is actually not bad .
however , eight thirty is a little too early for me .
I could offer you three $ P- $ M .
yes , I have just seen that will be in a meeting at three $ P- $ M .
I would say , would it perhaps suit you at two $ P- $ M ?
no , that is bad .
I have already got a dentist &apos; s appointment at two .
so I would suggest we postpone it perhaps to the week after .
oh , I have just seen it is Christmas then . that is perhaps not so convenient .
what would you say if we try it in January ?
okay , then I would say in the first week my secretary is on holiday .
that is bad .
make a suggestion , please .
that we get straight into it on Monday the eleventh of January .
let us say around ten ?
January the eleventh is great .
but is it perhaps also possible at a quarter past ten ?
now I can not really follow you .
do you mean a quarter past ten or a quarter past eleven ?
oh yes , of course , those Swabians .
fine , as you wish . as you like .
then I would say at a quarter past ten .
fine .
January the eleventh , a quarter past ten .
oh , there is something else . do you want to come to my office ?
if I want to come to your office ?
now I would say you come to my office .
that is much easier for all of us .
okay then , let us do it like that .
see you then , bye .
okay , Mr Wenzel .
bye .
Mr M &quot; uller , when will you have time for the next meeting ?
yes , Mr Klein , tomorrow on the twenty ninth I would still have time .
that is on Monday . at what time ?
that would be in the afternoon , at three o &apos;clock .
I am sorry , I have already got a meeting on the twenty ninth at three .
on Tuesday the thirtieth at three , that would be possible for me .
that is perhaps a bit tight .
how about half past three ?
yes , that is possible .
yes , Mr Klein , we must fix a date .
how about the twenty eighth of January ?
I am sorry but I will not be here in the week from the twenty seventh to February the first .
that is a pity . how about the twenty sixth ?
after four ?
on the twenty sixth I have got a meeting till three .
yes , that should be possible .
yes , let us fix that .
oh , I am sorry , that is very bad .
it would be better on the twenty fifth of May in the morning .
yes , now the twenty fifth of May does not really suit me .
I would prefer the twenty fourth in the afternoon .
oh , I am already booked the whole afternoon .
in the morning it would be good .
no , I think Monday is not possible either .
rather Wednesday afternoon .
actually I am quite busy the whole week .
let us try Tuesday the first of June .
the first two days in June , that is the first and the second , I will not be here .
then on Thursday afternoon or on Friday morning .
Thursday afternoon is great for me .
let us say two $ P- $ M ?
I would prefer half past two .
okay , when will you be free now ?
not before the thirty first .
what have you planned ?
so let us simply take April the seventh .
let us skip March .
wait a second , on the seventh .
no , the seventh is not possible , I will be away then .
and the second ?
on the second I have got a meeting from three to four $ P- $ M .
apart from that , it is possible .
great , I have got a seminar then .
what kind of dates are these ?
and on the sixth ?
when did you want ? on the sixth ?
I will already be away then .
how about the fifth ?
let us try the eighth .
now , on the eighth it is not possible for me between nine and eleven o &apos;clock ,
but apart from that , I will be free .
then let us do it at twelve .
from twelve to two .
okay , that is possible .
okay , let us do it from twelve to two .
fine , see you on the eighth , at twelve .
okay .
when will you have time for a meeting ?
well , let us see .
not on the twenty fifth between three and two $ P- $ M .
the twenty fifth is not possible at all .
the twenty second , I tell you straight away , is not possible either .
well , and how about the twenty seventh ?
that is again not possible .
the twenty eighth is bad for me .
the twenty ninth is not possible for me , nor is February the first .
how about February the second at four $ P- $ M ?
I will not be here on the second .
who set up your calendar ?
I have not finished yet .
on the third at three $ P- $ M .
that is possible .
now I have forgotten it .
fine , then it is February the third , three $ P- $ M .
okay , on the third .
I start .
okay , now we must have another meeting .
is it possible as early as May the twenty fourth at one $ P- $ M ?
no , I have already got a meeting at one $ P- $ M .
yes , before one $ P- $ M , afterwards it is no longer possible .
okay , let us forget about the twenty fourth .
how about the twenty sixth in the afternoon ?
okay , I must go to a seminar on the twenty sixth .
and on the twenty fifth at three ?
no , I have already got a meeting then .
what about the twenty seventh ?
on the twenty seventh I have got a seminar from nine thirty till four thirty .
and on the twenty eighth in the morning ?
exactly the same as on the twenty seventh .
so we must again postpone it till June .
how about June the third at twelve ?
at twelve , that is possible .
okay , then let us have the meeting on June the third at twelve .
fine , I note June the third , twelve till two o &apos;clock .
okay ?
okay .
okay , let us start as early as in August .
how about the fourth at two $ P- $ M ?
you have found a good date .
really , is that possible ?
yes , that is very good .
at two $ P- $ M .
okay , then let us fix that .
so see you on the fourth .
will you be free on November the twenty fourth in the morning ?
no .
and on the twenty second ?
no .
and on the twenty third ?
from eight till ten o &apos;clock , that would be possible .
okay .
and do not forget to write in your agenda while your secretary is ill .
we still have to find a date for a meeting .
okay , make a few suggestions when you will be free .
how about next week on Tuesday ?
Tuesday , let us have a look , wait a moment .
between eleven and half past twelve I have already got a meeting .
what is it like for you ?
from nine till eleven I have got a lecture and from two to three a meeting .
if the period between twelve thirty and two is enough we could meet then .
otherwise we will have to have a look what other dates would be possible .
well , I think that would be too tight for me .
how about the week afterwards ?
would you be free on Thursday ?
Thursday is comparatively bad , this day is already quite booked .
what do you think of Friday afternoon at , say , three o &apos;clock ?
no , I have got a meeting then .
I do not think that is possible .
let us have it one week earlier .
how about Friday the second ?
on the second , yes .
but it is only possible in the afternoon .
oh , I have got a meeting from three to four .
would you be free before or afterwards ?
you have got a meeting from three to four .
yes , before , I have got a seminar .
how about Wednesday the seventh ?
I have still got nothing planned then .
then , oh
that is difficult with you .
but I have just found Wednesday the thirty first .
is that possible for you ?
I am quite busy that day .
I am busy from nine thirty till eleven , only between eleven and twelve thirty .
yes , that is no problem for me .
but I have just seen that on Thursday the eighth I have only got a short meeting in the morning .
apart from that I would be free for something like that .
Thursday .
I have got a lecture from nine to eleven .
yes ,
I have also got a meeting from nine to eleven , but afterwards , when you are finished at eleven ,
that would be possible .
in the afternoon it is very good for me .
okay , then let us meet at two $ P- $ M on Thursday the eighth .
okay , where ?
okay , let us meet , as usual , in room three hundred and one .
hello Guido , do you still remember ? we wanted to fix a date for a meeting we have still got to hold .
and I thought that now it would be a good time to discuss everything .
sure , we could do that at the end of January .
on Friday the twenty ninth I have still got nothing planned .
that is not a good idea .
I will be away from the twenty seventh till the first of February .
business trip .
have you got another suggestion ?
oh , I must have a look .
I would be free on February the third , in the afternoon .
February the third , yes .
I would be free at two $ P- $ M .
two $ P- $ M is great for me .
so see you on the third .
so now we still need a date for our next meeting .
and I would be completely free on Tuesday the first of June .
yes , the first of June is bad , I will be away then .
on Wednesday , too .
eleven thirty if fine .
let us fix that , okay ?
okay , great , let us meet as usual at eleven thirty on Thursday .
Guido , listen , we still have to hold a meeting .
we should fix a date .
and I have thought on Thursday the twenty ninth .
it would be best in the morning .
would that be possible for you ?
in the morning it is really bad for me ,
I have got a lecture from nine till twelve o &apos;clock ,
but I would be free in the afternoon .
yes , the afternoon is bad , I have got a meeting then .
but what do you think about Tuesday the third of August at twelve thirty ?
on Monday and Tuesday I will be away .
perhaps we can arrange something on the sixth , on Friday morning ?
I will be away then , so that is bad .
but I have just seen that I have still got nothing planned at all for Friday the thirtieth .
oh , I did not see that I will be away then .
perhaps we will have to do it earlier .
on the twenty seventh ?
it would actually be best for me in the morning .
that is comparatively bad , I have got a seminar the whole day .
only at five $ P- $ M .
if we do not need too much time we can squeeze it in then .
or yes , at four thirty already .
okay , let us have it on the twenty seventh .
okay , see you then .
bye .
okay ,
then let us fix a date for the next meeting ,
and I would be free the whole day on October the sixth .
good for you .
I am actually away the whole week .
I will not be back before Thursday , and then I have got a seminar the whole day .
how about Wednesday the twenty ninth ?
I would be free the day before , on Tuesday afternoon .
that is bad for me .
I am really very busy the whole day .
but what do you think of Monday morning , Monday the twenty seventh ?
that is not possible either , I have got a lecture then .
and you , will you be here on the eighth of October ?
will you be free in the afternoon ?
I have got a seminar till five $ P- $ M then , and afterwards there probably will not be enough time .
well , that is bad .
what about a week earlier , in the afternoon ?
just as bad .
that is getting difficult .
how about Wednesday , Wednesday the twenty ninth ?
hey , we have already had that , I have got my seminar then .
but I could cancel my meeting on Friday and we could perhaps meet in the morning then .
yes , that is basically a good idea but I have got a seminar at ten .
I think I can not postpone it so easily .
let us have a look .
what is it like apart from that ?
could not you come at eight o &apos;clock ?
that we meet at eight o &apos;clock ?
okay , if you are already awake then , we will meet at eight .
of course I will be awake then .
so see you at eight .
on the eighth .
okay , see you then .
we still need a date for our next meeting .
well ,
I could offer you , for example , Monday the twenty ninth of November ,
some time in the morning it would suit me best .
that is very bad for me , I have got a lecture for three hours then .
it would be quite convenient for me if we could meet on Thursday the second of December in the afternoon .
yes , I do have a lecture then but it is not so important , I can drop it .
okay , see you then .
fine .
yes , the next appointment .
what do you think about the twenty ninth ?
I know that is relatively soon .
but let us say the twenty ninth in the morning ?
the twenty ninth in the morning is rather bad for me .
I have got a lecture until eleven o &apos;clock .
yes , and in the afternoon , too , it would not be possible before a quarter to three .
a quarter to three is not so good .
what do you think about a quarter to five ?
no , at a quarter to five I will almost have dinner .
so let us find another date .
I will just have a look .
the thirtieth . yes , inconvenient , the thirty first , too .
in the early morning at eight .
the thirty first at eight o &apos;clock . yes , that is okay .
okay . then see you on the thirty first .
now , concerning our meeting .
would Monday morning suit you ?
I would have lots of time then .
well , that is very , very bad .
in general it seems very bad in the next few weeks .
well , on Monday I am really only free from ten to eleven and that is not enough time for our meeting , and then again at five $ P- $ M .
and then we are already reaching the evening .
that is not so good , either .
I think Tuesday would be a lot better .
let us say Tuesday , around half past three .
Tuesday is very bad .
I have got a seminar the whole day , until four o &apos;clock , and afterwards still being prepared for that important business .
well , on Wednesday you have got no luck .
nor on Thursday , Friday and Monday , I will be on a business trip then .
so we can forget about that week .
Tuesday the second of February in the afternoon .
what do you think about the second of February in the afternoon , after three o &apos;clock ?
Tuesday is very bad , too .
I will be away the whole day then .
Wednesday would be possible again , Wednesday afternoon .
I have got a meeting until twelve o &apos;clock .
the afternoon would be perfect .
the afternoon is possible .
but not so early .
well , half past two .
half past two would be possible .
February the third at half past two ?
February the third , half past two .
I have taken it down .
so , meeting .
on Monday .
Monday the twenty fourth , Monday .
in the morning .
what do you think about that ?
I have already got a meeting on Monday morning .
Tuesday looks very bad .
but Wednesday afternoon would suit me .
on Wednesday I have got a seminar the whole day .
it is not possible on Wednesday .
on Thursday I have got a seminar , too , also on Friday .
the week after , on Monday , it would be possible again , in the morning .
I am on a business trip till the second of June .
on Thursday , either Thursday morning at eight or at twelve I would be available again .
well , in the morning at eight it would be possible .
but we have only got time until half past nine .
will these one and a half hours be enough for us ?
I really do not know .
it would also be possible for me in the afternoon .
you must make up your mind what you prefer .
yes , Thursday afternoon would suit me perfectly .
then we have got enough time for that business .
so it is Thursday at twelve .
so , our meeting .
what do you think of Monday afternoon at one o &apos;clock ?
on Monday I am booked the whole day , on Tuesday , too , on Wednesday I could squeeze something in .
either on Wednesday very early from eight till nine or in the afternoon , around one .
well , one hour seems a little short to me .
what do you think about Thursday afternoon ?
Wednesday afternoon would not be possible for you ?
you know , Thursday is quite bad for me , especially in the afternoon .
no , Wednesday afternoon , no way .
on the thirtieth I will be away until Tuesday .
but then either Wednesday at eight in the morning or at two .
well , Wednesday at eight in the morning suits me .
oh no , we said Tuesday , eight o &apos;clock in the morning , did not we ?
no , it was indeed Wednesday , eight o &apos;clock in the morning .
then we can leave it like that .
I am sorry . Wednesday was a mistake of mine .
on Tuesday it would be possible at eight , on Wednesday it would not .
let us say Wednesday afternoon , that was also possible for you .
okay .
so Wednesday afternoon at two ?
Wednesday afternoon at two is okay .
good morning , Icks speaking .
I am calling you to fix a time for our five day trip to the $ D $ G $ S $ F conference in Mannheim including the visit to $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen .
good morning , Ms Icks ,
when would it suit you ?
well , I would have time ,
I would be free from the seventeenth of January , for example ,
if that was the first day ,
to the twenty second of January .
I am sorry , but I will be in Mainz at $ Z $ D $ F on the eighteenth and nineteenth .
we also have to take into account that we have to hold a preparatory meeting beforehand .
maybe we should fix that first because it should be easier to find one day that suits both of us .
how long will your conference at $ Z $ D $ F be ?
it will be two days long , from the eighteenth to the nineteenth of January ,
would you mind holding the preparatory meeting at a weekend ?
yes , of course , that would be fine .
well , and when ?
how about the fourth of February , that is Saturday .
fine .
it is a bit late but it is possible with me .
let us fix that , okay .
and how about doing the five day trip the week directly afterwards ?
yes , that would be fine .
but I do not have time on the seventh and eighth ,
that means that we would have to do the five day trip over a weekend .
would that suit you ?
no problem .
we could go from the ninth to the fourteenth then .
yes , that is very fine with me , too .
and I would like to fix a time for having dinner with you in order to be able to discuss everything afterwards .
when would it suit you ?
well , do not you think we should do it right that week , beginning on the twentieth of February ?
that is not a bad idea actually .
but , in fact , that is shortly before Shrovetide ,
but how about the twenty first of February ?
that is Tuesday .
fine .
that is it then .
thank you very much
hello , Ms Wollnatz .
hello , I am calling you because we have to arrange our meeting .
it will be a five day trip during which we will be staying in Mannheim ,
and we will visit the $ B $ A $ S $ F factory in Ludwigshafen .
when would it suit you ?
well , in January , we have many appointments outside the office .
as we want to take our time only the second week of January would be possible , actually ,
which means between the ninth and the fifteenth .
that will be somewhat difficult with us because , as I mentioned , we will need five days , will not we ?
and you were saying , when exactly in January , sorry , I did not quite get you .
we will be back to work , at everyone &apos; s disposal , on Monday the ninth ,
that is when our team could start to go on a trip .
but at the end of the month it will not be possible as not all of our staff could participate then .
that would be a pity .
we are having a lot of appointments outside the office then .
well ,
that is somewhat difficult as we only have four days time after the ninth of January ,
and we do need five .
is it really not possible with you after , let us say , the seventeenth ?
or maybe in February ?
February would be better ,
we do have time from January the thirtieth until February the sixth inclusive .
I would say we could agree on not meeting until February then .
if we met on the first or the second of February we should still have five days until the sixth , would not we ?
all right ,
but how about meeting in January , just the two of us ,
to discuss all the arrangements , to agree upon the organization and the programme .
because I have just found some proposals by my colleagues who have given me papers with their agendas ,
I would like to talk about that with you .
would it be possible to make an appointment for January , for about two or three hours in the afternoon ?
yes ,
that is no problem ,
but I would prefer to at least agree upon the five days at the beginning of February .
so that we will not have any difficulties afterwards ,
I understand that your time is also limited ,
so that this is at least fixed .
yes , I have noted that ,
it is not a real organizational problem for us either ,
what do you think , you said at the end of January ,
would you like to come to my office on Tuesday the twenty fourth ?
in the afternoon ?
yes , no problem , on the twenty fourth , and when ?
after two or three o &apos;clock , as you are able to make it .
well , three o &apos;clock would be best then .
fine .
we can accomplish the preparations then .
I am having another idea now .
maybe we could have dinner together afterwards ,
would you like me to choose a restaurant and to reserve a table for us ?
well , I think we could arrange all this after the trip .
we have to be a bit flexible and adapt .
I meant during your visit to Bonn on Tuesday the twenty fourth ,
it is no big deal to reserve a table .
I assume that you will have some time after our meeting in order that we can have dinner together .
oh , excuse me , I got you wrong there ,
I thought you were talking about having dinner after our trip , to evaluate it ,
but if you are talking about having dinner together on the twenty fourth now ,
I do not mind , not at all .
while having dinner we could , in fact , agree upon what we would like to do after the five day trip ,
maybe planning comes easy to us then .
fine .
all right , goodbye .
thank you , and I am looking forward to see you on the twenty fourth .
me too .
goodbye .
hello , this is Ms Hummel of oh .
Ms Hummel ? are you still there ?
excuse me , I was interrupted for a moment .
I wanted to ask you if you would like to go on a five day trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim including a visit to $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen .
oh , yes , I have great interest .
I am surprised that you are inviting me on behalf of the company .
well , unfortunately , my diary is packed .
we would have to fix an exact time when to meet .
though your diary is packed , I would prefer to maybe hold a preparatory meeting beforehand if possible .
please tell me some times that would suit you .
a preparatory meeting would probably have to take place during the week as you have to come a long way .
in any case , I will be at my office at our company from the seventeenth to the twentieth if this is right .
are you free then as well ?
yes , I am free on the seventeenth and the twentieth but I already have plans for the eighteenth and the nineteenth .
well , I will be coming back from Berlin on the seventeenth .
how about the twentieth then ?
when could you be here in M &quot; onchengladbach ?
I think that it would be possible for me to be in M &quot; onchengladbach at about two o &apos;clock .
would that suit you ?
yes , two o &apos;clock in the afternoon would be fine ,
and everybody will be back from lunch then ,
I will note that in my diary right away , is that okay ?
fine , at two o &apos;clock ,
because on Friday the twentieth , Mister ,
could you tell me your , Mr Wieland .
right .
Mr Wieland .
and what was your name again ?
Ms Hummel .
all right , Ms Hummel , I have just put that down in my diary .
there should not be any problems .
at which phone number can I reach you if I will not be able to make it ?
if you can not make it please call me at number four ,
eight , three ,
eight , five .
four , eight , three , eight , five in Ludwigshafen , fine .
but I forgot ,
we do have to fix a time for the five day meeting as well ,
do you have enough time one week to say that five days in a row would be possible ?
well , February would be fine with me .
between the first and the fourteenth or between the seventeenth and the twenty eighth .
could you repeat that please ?
you said between the first to the fourteenth ?
yes , that is right ,
between the first and the fourteenth and from Friday the seventeenth to Tuesday the twenty eighth .
well , I might have time
how about from the first of February to
but that would be over the weekend .
would that be possible with you ?
would that suit you ?
though you proposed that I am not quite sure if this also suits you .
that is not a problem ,
I am also willing to work for the company at the weekend .
yes , that is right .
then I would propose to do it right at the beginning of February ,
because at the end I would have less
well , there are many more appointments ,
how about from the first to the fifth then ?
or maybe
of course , we also could , I think ,
no , from the first to the fifth ?
yes , that would be fine ,
I will take a flight from Honolulu right on Tuesday the thirty first then , and I will be at the congress on Wednesday at about three o &apos;clock , for sure ,
I would miss the first hours at the most if it is already going to start in the morning .
let us agree upon that day then .
if you have time afterwards I would like to take you out for dinner .
is there a weekend or rather a day before the weekend that would suit you ?
well , as I said , I will not have any appointments from Monday to Friday ,
and I would like to meet for dinner then .
Friday inclusive you would be free ,
how about Friday the tenth ?
yes , no problem .
and where shall we meet ?
have you already thought of a restaurant ?
yes , I thought of the Thai restaurant in Ostseestra &quot; se ,
do you know that ?
well , I do not like Thai cuisine that much ,
maybe we could agree on going to an Indonesian restaurant .
or maybe a Chinese one .
or , no , it should not be an ordinary take away .
I would prefer the Indonesian one then .
Indonesian cuisine , fine .
how about the Tai Pen in K &quot; olner Gasse ?
that would be fine .
and at what time ?
eight o &apos;clock , and I reserve a table ?
eight o &apos;clock , the Tai Pen , on Friday the tenth .
right .
all right , Mr Wieland .
goodbye .
goodbye , Ms Hummel .
hello , this is Groth speaking .
I wanted to talk about a trip to a conference in Mannheim with you , the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference you also wanted to take part in , as far as I know .
well , it will be a five day trip and I would like to know when it suits you best .
I have been waiting for your call for some time ,
I therefore appreciate you calling as I did not have your telephone number .
the new year is beginning soon and I will not be available during the holidays ,
therefore I am glad to be able to arrange all the dates with you today .
I propose to already meet at the beginning of the new year as I am free between the second and the seventeenth of January ,
would it suit you any time then ?
that is a bit difficult with me ,
from new years day to the sixth of January is really not so good as the children are still away from school and I , well , want to stay with the family ,
and on the fifteenth , a Sunday , there will be a congress in Berlin ,
and that weekend is really problematic with me .
but maybe we could meet some day in between to meet before the $ D $ G $ F $ S congress in Mannheim ,
to do some preparatory work .
yes , that would be fine with me ,
I have got plenty of time during the week from the ninth to the thirteenth ,
just fix a day and a time ,
and I would propose to meet here in Bonn again .
how about Tuesday then , maybe at about half past ten ? earlier will not be possible with me because I am going to take the train .
I can pick you up at the station then ,
it would be best if you called me again to tell me when your train is going to arrive , and I will get in touch with you again .
let us agree on Tuesday the tenth at half past ten then , and I will pick you up when your train arrives .
I would like to talk about the five day trip now , which is quite important .
my suggestion is the end of January , the beginning of February or the middle of February as the last days in February are a bit late for me ,
actually , as I am from the Rhineland and do celebrate Shrovetide , usually ,
and I would like to have the conference done before .
of course , I understand ,
I would prefer the beginning of February then , as I have several appointments at the end of January .
in February , I am free until the fourteenth .
would that suit you ?
yes , until the fourteenth suits me fine ,
we could either take the week that ends on Thursday the ninth and Friday the tenth ,
the weekend , that is the eleventh and the twelfth , and include the following Monday ,
how do you feel about that ?
yes , that would be fine ,
but five days would be enough ,
that would be , one ,
two ,
three , four ,
five , from Thursday the ninth on then .
yes ,
you got me right there , this is because I will be on a congress in Munich on the seventh and the eighth and otherwise it would be a bit stressful .
well , from the ninth on would suit me fine .
fine , and afterwards we could have dinner together if that is all right with you .
on the fifteenth and the sixteenth I have a meeting at the $ B $ M $ F $ T but I would be pleased if you had time for having dinner together .
well ,
Monday the twentieth , Tuesday the twenty first and Wednesday the twenty second would be possible then ,
as Thursday the twenty third already is Weiberfastnacht ,
and I already planned to go out with my best friends then .
I would appreciate if we could agree on one of those three days .
for dinner , I would suggest the Petersberg or the Redoute if that suits you .
I was told that they are going to have this nice goose again which I would really like to eat .
well , no , I am a vegetarian , but they will have salad as well .
Monday the twentieth would be fine with me then , after the weekend .
all right , I recap :
the preparatory meeting is on Tuesday the tenth ,
we will go to Mannheim together from Thursday , the ninth of February , to February the thirteenth or fourteenth ,
I hope that the conference will be a success ,
and we are looking forward to having dinner together in one of our luxurious restaurants here in Bonn at the end of February .
fine , let us fix that .
well , see you on Tuesday the tenth of January then , if nothing unexpected happens ,
if there is anything to talk about in the meantime I will call you or I give you my number now .
fine , I would like to say goodbye then and to wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year and please give your husband and your children ,
who I already got to know , my kind regards .
all right , the number is : zero ,
five , two ,
eight , three ,
eighteen , fourteen ,
if there are any questions ,
and thank you very much and I also wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello , Dr Schmidt , this is Prof . M &quot; uller of the university of Heidelberg .
I told you that I was going to call you again because of the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim we will participate in
and a visit to $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen was to be on the programme as well .
have you thought about a time when to hold the conference ?
thank you , Prof M &quot; uller .
it is always the best to hold the conference over a weekend so that not too many lectures have to be cancelled .
how about from the tenth to the fifteenth of January nineteen ninety five , for example ?
well , basically , that is a good idea ,
I also think that not too many lectures should have to be cancelled as I also consider it to be unbearable that many of our colleagues do not take their duty of holding lectures for serious ,
well , a weekend is basically fine ,
but I am afraid I am on a congress in Berlin on the fifteenth ,
that is really not possible .
and the congress will actually be from the thirteenth to the sixteenth ,
that is not so good ,
maybe we should look for another time .
how about February then , from the first to the fifth .
yes , that is fine ,
it is still some time before Shrovetide ,
we have to consider that $ B $ A $ S $ F have to have time then for our group of visitors .
well , that seems to be all right .
we can fix that .
from the first to the fifth of February , I note that .
yes , that is fine .
the week after I have to go to a congress in Munich .
but that is possible .
fine , I will note that then .
and I could contact $ I $ D $ S in Mannheim then , and they will arrange it ,
they are experienced in organizing conferences as far as the place etcetera . are concerned .
we also need a preparatory meeting that should be held beforehand but not too long before ,
maybe in the second half of January .
yes , of course , you just said that you will not be free after the twelfth , thirteenth , fourteenth , fifteenth ,
I would suggest between the twenty third and the twenty fifth ?
well ,
on the twenty fifth I have a press conference at the $ F $ A $ Z in Frankfurt ,
but on the twenty third or the twenty fourth it would be possible ,
as you prefer , either Monday or Tuesday .
yes , that is fine .
I will come to see you by train then as it is not far from Heidelberg ,
and then , yes , that is fine .
in the afternoon , you said ?
well , three o &apos;clock , I do not know the train schedules .
maybe four o &apos;clock suits you better .
three o &apos;clock is fine .
I remember the institute you are working with .
it has not changed , has it ?
and your office is still the same room , is not it ?
that is still the same one .
three o &apos;clock , I note that right away ,
if anything unexpected happens we can contact each other .
how do you feel about having dinner together after the conference in order to talk about it in a nice atmosphere .
that is a good idea , Dr Schmitz .
if possible after the conference , so that everything is still vivid ,
I thought of the week directly after the conference .
maybe on a Friday , that is the best day for it as the week is over then ,
or on Saturday when the stress has gone .
Friday would be fine .
where shall we meet then ?
is it , shall we meet in Heidelberg or at my place ?
I do not mind ,
as I have not been to your place , that is , the city you live in ,
for some time we could meet there for a change ,
I am sure you know some good restaurants .
yes , fine .
let us meet on Friday then ,
I will pick you up at the station
and , well , round about six or seven o &apos;clock ?
yes , that is all right .
there are two Intercity trains per hour .
I will be at the station at six o &apos;clock then .
all right , at six o &apos;clock on the tenth .
yes .
I assume that we are going to contact each other again but , basically ,
we will meet on January the twenty third at three o &apos;clock .
right .
and we can arrange everything else then .
we fixed a time for the conference ,
that will not change a lot .
unless the people in Mannheim do not have time then , but I do not believe that .
fine , we arranged everything then .
I wish you a happy new year then and see you on January the twenty third , Dr Schmitz .
same to you .
see you , bye .
goodbye .
hello , this is Verena L &quot; ohr .
I wanted to arrange a five day trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim with you .
a visit to $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen is supposed to be included .
what is planned in your diary ?
hello , Ms L &quot; ohr ,
do you know when exactly the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference is going to take place ?
we can choose any time .
that is really fine .
my suggestion is at the beginning , January the seventeenth .
January the seventeenth is right before our visit at $ Z $ D $ F in Mainz ,
if possible , I would actually prefer a time a bit later .
well , at about January the twenty fifth there is a press conference in Frankfurt that I could postpone easily .
if you could postpone it we would be very glad .
when will your appointment at $ Z $ D $ F be , Ms L &quot; ohr ?
on January the eighteenth and nineteenth .
yes , that would be possible with me .
well ,
let us get that straight : this year &apos; s ,
next year &apos; s $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim will take place from January the twentieth to January the twenty fourth in the evening .
yes , that would be fine .
but we also have to arrange a preparatory meeting to talk about the organization .
yes , we should do that two weeks before the conference to have enough time if anything unexpected should arise .
that would already be at the beginning of January then .
yes , maybe in the second week of January , round about the ninth , tenth of January .
yes , that would be possible .
I suggest Tuesday , January the tenth then .
would you maybe like to come to our place in the morning ?
how long is the meeting supposed to take ?
well , seven or eight hours , I think .
yes , that is possible then .
fine , Ms L &quot; ohr , I put that down in my diary for Tuesday , January the tenth beginning at half past ten .
yes , all right .
how about having dinner together after the trip ?
we will want to sit together after the conference , I suggest .
yes , Ms L &quot; ohr , we thought of that as well ,
maybe to say thank you to your company .
maybe we could have dinner together around January the twenty seventh , twenty eighth .
twenty seventh , twenty eighth , that is Shrovetide ,
that is always a real chaos here in Cologne ,
well , a bit earlier would suit us better if that is possible .
well , we should do it after the conference .
I would prefer to postpone it to February then .
what does your diary tell you for the beginning of February ?
the beginning of February is a good idea , I will only be on a congress in Munich on February the seventh and eighth .
I suggest the third or Saturday , February the fourth then .
Friday would suit me better than the weekend .
Friday , February the third .
I just put that down in my diary .
thank you very much for arranging these appointments , goodbye , see you .
goodbye .
hello , this is M &quot; uller speaking ,
I want to talk about the announced five day trip , a preparatory meeting and a posterior meeting with you ,
in January and February nineteen ninety five .
is there a period of time during which you have a lot of time ?
hello , Mr M &quot; uller ,
I am just thinking about it .
there is new years day , and then Epiphany , maybe from Monday the ninth to Friday the thirteenth .
well ,
I would prefer to do the trip at the beginning of February ,
the preparations at the end of January and the posterior meeting at the end of February .
would that be possible with you ?
the end of February , that would be really fast
that is not so good with me as we are having Shrovetide here
maybe February the twentieth for having dinner .
fine .
perfect . perfect .
and could we say from the first to the sixth of February for the trip ?
yes . fine .
perfect .
and as to the preparation , well , whenever it suits you .
well , for example , on January the twenty seventh .
I will be just coming back from Cologne then ,
that will be somewhat difficult ,
how about January the twenty third ?
yes , I would have time then as well .
let us agree on the twenty third then .
all right .
well , thank you , I am looking forward to it .
thank you , goodbye .
hello , Mr Wetzlar , this is Oertel speaking .
I am calling you because of what we agreed upon .
we planned to go to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim for five days ,
including a visit to $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen .
when would you have time ?
it is good that you are calling , Ms Oertel .
I also planned to call you to fix a time with you .
what do you think ,
should the visit or rather the trip be during the week or is it also possible to do it over the weekend ?
it may as well be over the weekend .
but I have to mention that the only weekend that would be possible for me in January is Saturday and Sunday , the twenty first and the twenty second , some time around that time .
that is fine , from Friday the twentieth to Wednesday the twenty fifth that is exactly five days .
my diary tells me that I could do a business trip then .
would it be possible to advance it one day , because on Wednesday the twenty fifth there is a press conference at the $ F $ A $ Z .
I am afraid I have to disappoint you .
my diary is also quite packed and I will be in Mainz that week from the sixteenth to the twentieth .
my suggestion would be to concentrate on Wednesday , excuse me , on February to find a time we are both free .
yes , that is also possible as I have virtually no appointment during the first two weeks .
I suggest to go to Mannheim and Ludwigshafen together from Wednesday , February the first ,
to Monday , February the sixth , then .
yes , perfect .
but we have to meet before to talk about the subjects .
could you make a suggestion for a time that would suit you ?
how about Friday , January the twenty seventh ?
that would be fine .
I will be in Cologne then anyway , so I could go to see you right after that .
and how do feel about having dinner together afterwards ?
shall we do that right after the trip or shall we let pass a couple of days ?
I have to tell you that I already have another appointment on Tuesday , February the seventh and eighth ,
but in the following week I would have time to meet one evening to talk about the lecture and all that .
how about Tuesday , February the fourteenth ?
that would be fine as I do not have any appointments during that week yet .
and we will meet on Friday , January the twenty seventh for the preparatory meeting then .
fine , all right .
see you then , goodbye , Mr Wetzlar .
goodbye .
hello , Ms Konnertz ,
I am calling you because of the conference in Mannheim we wanted to arrange .
are you fully informed of that ?
well ,
I was told that we are supposed to organize it ,
that we should contact each other ,
that it is to be five days long ,
that we are to hold a preparatory meeting beforehand and maybe have dinner afterwards to conclude the conference .
that is what I was told .
does that correspond with what you know ?
I also think it is useful ,
because , if we prepare it well beforehand ,
I think , the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference could turn out to be a real success .
probably , there will not be too many participants , we therefore could fix a time when to do it .
when would it suit you ?
well , basically , I would prefer February to January as I already have a congress in Berlin and a press conference at the $ F $ A $ Z in January .
is that the same with you ?
February is more difficult with me as there is a visit to the $ D $ F $ K $ I in Saarbr &quot; ucken and the one at $ Z $ D $ F in Mainz ,
no , I just noticed that is in January .
let us see , maybe February is possible ,
would you mind doing it over a weekend ?
no , that would be fine with me .
well , how about from Friday the tenth to Wednesday the fifteenth of February , for example ?
oh , I am afraid I do not have time then as there is a meeting at the $ B $ M $ F $ T on Wednesday .
I would have time after Friday the seventeenth .
would that suit you ?
unfortunately , I have to go to the $ D $ F $ K $ I in Saarbr &quot; ucken on the seventeenth ,
but if it was possible at the weekend , that is from Saturday the eighteenth , although five days will be a bit difficult ,
well ,
to Wednesday the twenty second ,
but from Thursday the twenty third on I will be occupied .
I do not know ,
but that will probably be a little bit hard for you ,
even more as we have to hold a preparatory meeting beforehand .
if you are busy until Friday the seventeenth .
how about doing it in January still , maybe from Friday the twentieth on .
that would be until Tuesday the twenty fourth then .
yes , that would be just possible as I have another appointment on the twenty fifth ,
but this dinner afterwards is not this rigid ,
we could maybe do that two days later as well ,
and the conference could take place during this period of time .
yes , that would be fine with me .
we could have dinner
we could let some time pass before having dinner so that we can digest our experiences and talk about what was good and what was not .
all right , but we also have to think about when to fit in the visit to $ B $ A $ S $ F in Ludwigshafen as Friday is a bad day because they do not work that long then ,
Monday or Tuesday would be best then , what do you think ?
you mean , during those five days that we are meeting , do not you ?
well , I think that it would be nice for a change not to sit at a round table all the time .
well ,
I think Monday the twenty third would be best then because Tuesday already is the last day .
do you want me to arrange that and to call the $ B $ A $ S $ F factory ?
I would really appreciate that ,
and should any problems occur you might call me again .
I will do that ,
we only have to fix a time for the preparatory meeting then .
maybe we should not do that on the last day before the conference but a little bit earlier in order to be able to solve any problems that might occur .
maybe you could make a suggestion as I
well , maybe you could make a suggestion .
well , actually , that is all the same with me as I do not have any appointments before January the seventeenth .
maybe you better say something as I really have any option .
fine , well ,
I will be at a congress in Berlin from the thirteenth to the sixteenth but I would have time on Wednesday , January the eleventh , for example .
yes , that is fine with me ,
that is really all the same with me .
let us agree on that .
and when ?
my suggestion would be , maybe eleven o &apos;clock ?
but maybe four o &apos;clock in the afternoon ?
four o &apos;clock in the afternoon is fine as well .
all right .
fine .
the usual place ?
I would say yes .
fine .
thank you very much then , and goodbye .
we forgot something : when could we arrange this dinner afterwards , after the conference ?
do not you think we should discuss that at the conference itself to settle it with the participants ?
we could , but maybe , to have some suggestions to make .
I could imagine not doing it before February .
between Wednesday the first and Sunday the fifth it would suit me fine ,
if we could do it during that period of time .
I am free then as well ,
we can agree on that to already tell the participants to choose a time during that period
to think about it .
right , I also consider this to be useful .
we fixed that then .
I am looking forward to Wednesday the eleventh then , that is what we have said , is not it ?
right , at four o &apos;clock , fine .
thank you very much , goodbye .
goodbye , Ms Konnertz .
hello , Mr Spielhoven , Becher speaking .
I am calling you in order to fix a time for the five day trip to the $ D $ G $ F $ S conference in Mannheim .
hello , Mr Becher ,
it is nice to talk to you .
let us see when it is possible .
I would suggest the week from Monday the ninth to Friday the thirteenth of January then ,
well , Monday , January the ninth to Friday the thirteenth .
I just notice that I have to leave for a congress in Berlin on Friday the thirteenth .
that will be too stressful for me then .
I , personally , am not very happy with January ,
February , the beginning of February would suit me better .
if we agreed on the beginning of February , Mr Becher , it would be possible ,
from Wednesday the first to Sunday the fifth , for example , though that would be over the weekend .
but the preparatory meeting would have to take place at the end of January already .
that would be possible .
it is no problem to do it over the weekend ,
although my wife is certainly going to complain a little bit , but I think she is getting used to it .
shall we fix that week then ?
from Wednesday the first to Sunday the fifth .
yes , fine , let us fix that ,
and we have to agree on a time for the preparatory meeting now .
I think it should not be too short before ,
I suggest Saturday , January the twenty eighth so that we will still have some days in between .
yes , fine , that is all right with me as well .
would you know a nice restaurant here in Bonn ?
yes , we could certainly go out for dinner together after the preparatory meeting .
that is a very good idea .
I think we should allow ourselves to go to the Maritim as it is such an important conference .

I just check when I would be free .
the first would be during the week or the days from the fourteenth of July to the eighteenth of July .
would that suit you ?
that looks bad .
I am booked from the fourteenth to the eighteenth of July .
I would be free from Tuesday , the twentieth of July to and including Monday the second of August .
if this time would suit you ?
no , this looks bad for me .
I have to switch to August then .

this looks bad again .
I am not free from the third to the ninth .
later for five days in a row I would be free on from the thirteenth to the seventeenth of August .
would you possibly be free then ?
no , this does not work unfortunately .
then we have to switch to September .
it would be possible for me from the first of September to the eighth of September .
this is bad for me again .
but perhaps it does suit you some time between the ninth and the seventeenth .
this could suit me .
from the tenth though , the ninth is not free .
let me check , maybe the best would be from Monday the thirteenth of September to Friday the seventeenth .
great , let us fix this then , this suits me , too .
Monday till Friday the seventeenth , all right .

if this suits you .
tomorrow , Friday , I have just noticed that I am not free at all .
perhaps we should put it off to next week .
would you be free on Monday ?
Monday would suit me fine between twelve and four $ P- $ M
would that suit you , too ?
yes , I have no plans then .
let us fix this , between twelve and four $ P- $ M .

hello , Mr J &quot; ansch .
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
we can certainly do so .
it would suit me between the thirteenth and the seventeenth of August .
this is pretty bad .
I will be out of town then .
July is not suitable for you ?
yes , it is , in July , let us say after the twentieth ?
this is bad , too , we then have to go to September .
some time between the first and the sixth or between the tenth and the nineteenth .

the first one is from Monday the twenty sixth of July to Friday the thirtieth of July , or from Monday the thirteenth of September to Friday the seventeenth of September .
as far as September is concerned , I would be free then .

this does not suit me .
you do not have time afterwards .

hello ,
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
and a date that would suit me would be ,
for example , from Monday the fifth to Friday the eleventh .
what do you think about that ?
I am not free at all then .
I will not be free before Wednesday the thirteenth and we would have to include the weekend to meet us there .
would you generally mind dividing the working session in two parts because of a weekend ?
in general I would not mind , but on Monday and on Tuesday , eighteenth and nineteenth ,
I have an appointment , so this cannot work .
the next date that would suit me would be in February then ,
that is from the eighth to the twelfth ,
Monday to Friday .
from the eighth to the twelfth of February I am totally booked , unfortunately , I would not be free at all then .
in February I would only be free from Monday the fifteenth to Tuesday the twenty third or again from the twenty fifth to the third of March .

there is not a single day I would be free ,
but I see a possibility for the second date you mentioned .

hello ,
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
when do you wish to have this appointment ?
what do you think about Wednesday the thirteenth of January to Tuesday the nineteenth of January ?
this is impossible for me , as I go to L &quot; ubeck from the eighteenth to the nineteenth .
would it be suitable for you in the following week ?
the following week only from Wednesday the twenty seventh ,
and later not before Thursday the fourth unfortunately , we would have to include Friday then .
bad .
what would you think about Monday , the fifteenth to Friday the nineteenth ?
during that week I have no time at all .
I would suggest the beginning of March , this is from the first to the fifth .
I am not free then .
I could only make it from the eight to the twelfth .
this is not suitable for me this time .
I will be out of town on the twelfth .
fifteenth to nineteenth , or at the end of March .

I am actually pretty busy this month but maybe we can arrange something .
I forgot to introduce myself , my name is J &quot; ansch .
it is spelled $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
okay , let us start then .
it would suit me fine between the twenty first and the twenty fifth of May .
between the twenty first and the twenty fifth of May it would also suit me fine , for example between the seventeenth of May and the twenty first of May .
the problem is that I am already booked on the seventeenth on May .
I will not be free until the nineteenth , that is between the nineteenth and the twenty sixth it would suit me .
this includes a weekend though , but if this suits you .
a weekend is no problem for me .
I am usually free then .
okay , done .
let us take this date then .
okay , all right .
hello ,
my name is Quell .
it is spelled $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
I would like to make an appointment with you on a Saturday in June , for a business meal
I can already tell you that I am not free on the twenty sixth and the fifth .
then only the twelfth and the nineteenth actually come into consideration .
hello , , Mrs Quell
my name is Walberg , it is spelled $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
for me the nineteenth would be suitable , too .
I am booked from seven to ten $ P- $ M though .
I would say that this should not be a problem for us .
we can go out for lunch and not for dinner then .
the nineteenth would actually suit me , too .
okay , let us make it on the nineteenth of June at twelve $ A- $ M , all right ?
yes , all right .
hello ,
my name is Niehmeyer .
it is spelled $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
we have to make an appointment during this week or in the beginning of next week .
when would it suit you ?
hello ,

let us agree on Monday the fifth , okay ?
all right , goodbye .
hello ,

a business trip ,
and I would like to meet you to talk about the details .
when would it be convenient for you ?
I am glad Mrs Sudniz
my name is Flex .
that you want to go on a business trip with me .
I would suggest to go on a weekend .
weekends are also very suitable for me .
it would even suit me to take the weekend which includes Easter Monday , as I am totally free then .
I am sorry but between the eighth and the thirteenth I will be out of town .
it has to be another day then .
what about May , on the weekend fifteenth , sixteenth ?
I will not be here either .
apart from that this would be too late .
all right , I think we perhaps should arrange a date during the week .
suitable for me would be the Thursday before good Friday .
as I already told you before , I will not be in town from the eighth to the thirteenth .
but I would be free the day before , Wednesday the seventh after one $ P- $ M .
this would actually suit me , too .
then let us make it on Wednesday the seventh around two $ P- $ M .
okay , let us say two $ P- $ M sharp .
all right , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
and I wanted to make a date with you .
yes , thank you very much .
let us check the possibilities .
in July I would be free on the following days .
I would be free between the twentieth of July and even the second of August .
apart from that I have five days in a row free in August from the thirteenth and the seventeenth ,
later between the twenty fourth of August and the first of September and then in September between the ninth and the seventeenth .
I am booked on the weekend .
I will be free again between the twentieth of September and the thirtieth of September , too .
if possible the meeting should take place in August , but I do not see any possibility right now .
September would be convenient for me .
this would be suitable for both of us .
thank you , this is all right .
okay , I write this down and we will make it quickly .
thank you , goodbye .
hello ,
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I would like to make an appointment with you for a business meal on a Sunday in August .
it would suit me on the fifteenth of August and on the twenty ninth of August as well as on the first of August .
hello ,
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
the application for a business meal is a honour for me , but I first have to look in August , as there is a holiday ,
Assumption day , at the fifteenth .
actually , the only convenient Sunday for me would be the twenty ninth or possibly Sunday the eighth .
now it is up to you to decide which date would be more suitable for you .
let us take Sunday the twenty ninth of August .
all right with me , at what time ?
this is up to you .
then I would say eight $ P- $ M
all right , thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
my name is $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
this is urgent .
I am looking for a date for a short conference that has to take place either during this week or at the latest in the beginning of next week .
today is Thursday the first of July , so maybe , this afternoon is bad .
perhaps tomorrow during the whole day or next Monday at the latest .
if there is no other possibility at all , we could also make it on a weekend .
hello ,
my name is Niehmeyer .
the weekend is all right with me , no problems .
would you prefer Saturday or Sunday ?
let us say Saturday at nine $ A- $ M ?
nine o &apos;clock in the morning , that suits me fine .

I am already looking forward to it .
okay , see you the day after tomorrow .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I would like to make an appointment with you for some travel preparations .
today would be suitable for me , I will be free all the time .
unfortunately today does not suit me at all .
but I think there is no hurry for the travel preparations .
I would therefore suggest August , the beginning of August .
it would suit me on Tuesday at six $ P- $ M for example ,
Tuesday the third of August at six $ P- $ M would be very convenient for me .
too bad ,
Monday the ninth of August would be the next free day for me .
not between eleven and three $ P- $ M though .
Monday the ninth of August would not be a problem for me either ,
but not before six $ P- $ M unfortunately .
six $ P- $ M is okay with me .
but maybe we should make it a little bit later to have some time in between .
let us say seven $ P- $ M ,
I am free at seven $ P- $ M , all right .
okay , Monday the ninth at seven $ P- $ M .
thanks , I am looking forward to it .
hello ,
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .

in August between the third and the ninth and finally in September between the first and the eighth ,
and the tenth and the nineteenth .
what about you ?
hello ,
Mr G &quot; urtner this is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
unfortunately I have to say no to August and September , it does not suit me at all then .
but in September between the tenth and the seventeenth or between the ninth and the seventeenth of September I would be free for the whole week .
you can be sure that I will come to the meeting then .
yes , that is all right .
if we include the weekend we could start on the tenth and finish on the fifteenth .
is this all right with you ?
this would be no problem for me .
this would suit me perfectly fine .
thanks , let us leave it at this then .
all right , see you then , goodbye .
goodbye .

this is all right with me .
you just have to fix a time now .
yes , that is all right with me .
thank you , see you on Friday .

I have to disappoint you , it is impossible .
now it is me who is not available .
but Friday the twenty ninth of January .
no , this is maddening .
Friday twenty ninth does not suit me .

this is not possible , unfortunately .
what do you think about Friday the fifth of February ?
on Friday the fifth I will be in L &quot; ubeck .
Tuesday the ninth or Friday the twelfth ?
I am booked on both days , unfortunately .
one more try , Tuesday the sixteenth .
Tuesday the sixteenth does not suit me at all .
I can already tell you that I will be booked in the following week as well .
I will be in Cologne .
now , either on the twenty sixth of February or in March .
Friday the twenty sixth of February would be perfect .
I am free then and this at any time .

I would be totally free from the seventeenth of May to the thirtieth of May .
during this period of time I would be free between the eighteenth of May and the twenty sixth . we could meet then .

I would like to make an appointment for a working session , which has to last five days in Kiel .
hello ,
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
we could already try to find a date .
would it suit you from the fifth to the eighth of April ?
till the eighth ?
unfortunately I already have plans for the eighth .
what about ?
April is pretty bad for me .
I would be free in May , perhaps from the seventeenth to the twenty eighth .
would that suit you ?
I am already booked then , unfortunately .
the following week would be better .
that would be suitable for me , too .
when would you be free ?
perhaps from Friday to Tuesday , the twenty first to the twenty fifth of May .
yes , we could meet then , that would be possible .
hello ,
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
do you think we can arrange that ?
perhaps on the twelfth of June ?
hello ,
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
the twelfth of June is bad ,
but the eleventh of June would suit me fine ,
or the following week would be excellent as I have a lot of time then .
Saturdays are always more convenient for me .
what about the nineteenth or the twelfth of June , no , the nineteenth of June ?
yes the nineteenth would suit me , too .
that would be all right .
shall we stick to the nineteenth ?
I would be very pleased .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
I would like to make an appointment with you for a short conference either during this week or in the beginning of next week .
as today is the first of April , I would suggest to meet either tomorrow already , Friday or Sunday .
I would be free on Monday and Wednesday , too .
what would be suitable for you ?
hello ,
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
it would also suit me on Friday ,
but not before three $ P- $ M , on Sunday I am booked ,
on Monday I would be free for the whole day and on Wednesday until two $ P- $ M and then from six $ P- $ M .
it is up to you to choose one of the days .
Monday was convenient for you .
is that correct ?

on Monday I will be free for the whole day .
I would suggest to meet on Monday at two $ P- $ M .
is that all right ?
thank you very much for arranging this date with me .
you are welcome , goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
my name is von Sudniz , $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I would like to make an appointment to prepare a trip .
what do you think about getting over with it as soon as possible ?
yes ,
that suits me fine , but I have to tell you that I will be pretty busy during the first week and from the twentieth till the end it would suit me relatively fine .
by the way , my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
okay , for me the thing is that I am pretty busy now , at the beginning of April .
what about the week from the fifth of April , before Easter ?
this is pretty bad for me , I must admit .
from the twentieth of April .
we will not need a lot of time , I think one day should be enough .
either from the twentieth of April ,
I would have three days then ,
or from the twenty fourth of April where I would have four days free .
would one of these days suit you ?
unfortunately I will be out of town from the twentieth to the twenty sixth .
only a later day would be possible .
let us take either the twenty seventh or the twenty eighth of April , in the morning if it suits you .
I would have sufficient time then .
in the morning I am only available on Wednesday , this is the twenty eighth .
before two am .
is this all right with you ?
yes , that would be suitable for me .
then we stick to Wednesday morning ?
yes , I would like to .
thanks again .
you are welcome , goodbye .
goodbye .
I am Mr G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I am the right person for this .
my name is J &quot; ansch , it is spelled $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
when would you have time for this appointment ?
I thought perhaps as soon as possible ,
that is from next Monday ,
the fifth of April .
I think that we would have to include good Friday , but apart from that it would suit me fine .
you have to know , I am sorry , but I have some important conferences then , it is impossible .
what about the last week in June ?
the last week in June .
do you mean from the twenty fifth of June on , over Saturday and Sunday ?
I see , this is not too good .
but I have a very busy month here .
what about the week in June from the fourth , including a weekend ?
I have an important date on Saturday and on Monday it would not suit me either .
this is bad .
but I would perhaps be free on the following Wednesday or even Tuesday , on Tuesday the eighth of June .
that does not suit me either .
unless we reduce our appointment to four days .
how do you feel about that ?
I did not think about it , yet .
it should be a five day session , should not it ?
let us see where we can find four days .
you said that it would suit you on the first of June ?
no , I am sorry .
I will not be free until the fourth .
not until the fourth of June .
as I said , I have an appointment on the fifth and the sixth .
on the eighth of June then ?
no , I think we already talked about that .
I think we should better look in May .
I am sorry I am also booked then .
what about the fifth of May ?
I am booked then , I am booked for five days in a row .
this is bad , but we could perhaps divide it into two parts .
maybe the tenth , eleventh , twelfth of May and then the fourteenth , fifteenth of May .
this does not suit me at all .
but we could dividing it is a good idea , we could perhaps meet on Ascension day .
how do you feel about that ?
how many days will you be free around Ascension day ?
I would actually be free from the Wednesday before Ascension day to yes , I would be free then .
even five days .
but I think , you only were free for three or four days then .
no . I would also be free then .
let us fix this date then .
from the nineteenth of May , this is the twentieth , twenty one , two , to the twenty fourth of May .
yes .
let us fix the date then ,
from the nineteenth to the ,
wait , three , this would only be to the twenty third ,
to the Sunday .
I wish you all the best .
see you then .
thanks for talking to me , Mr G &quot; urtner .
hello ,
my name is Walberg , it is spelled $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
the reason for my call is a business meal on a Saturday in June .
hello , this is Mr Quell .
let me spell it , too , $ Q $ U $ E double $ L , and this would be all right .
which day would suit you ?
the fifth would suit me fine .
wait , I am booked on the fifth .
but the twelfth would suit me .
I am not free until the twenty sixth .
the twenty sixth does not suit me .
I would only be free on the nineteenth .
in June we could cross this appointment out then .
as I see ,
as I am booked on the fifth and on the twenty sixth and you are not free on the twelfth and the nineteenth .
then we should perhaps put this off to a Sunday .
I would actually be free on the nineteenth but only for lunch and not for dinner .
as this is a business meal , this is no problem .
this would be for lunch , I would suggest to meet on the nineteenth for lunch .
would that be all right then ?
this would be nice .
let us say at twelve ?
I will give you another call .
okay , thank you .
I will see you then , goodbye .
hello ,

during this week I would principally have time from Friday to Monday ,
this is on Friday during the whole day and on Monday between twelve and four $ P- $ M .
I am sorry , I am booked then , unfortunately .
how do you feel about the beginning of next week ?
for example on Tuesday , at ten $ A- $ M .
next week from Tuesday to Friday I will be in Hambur .
therefore it would not be possible before the week after next week on Monday .
unfortunately , I will not have time then either .
and this Saturday ?
but this is on a weekend .
on Saturday , the third ?
Saturday the third would suit me .
yes , let us fix that .
okay , let us make it on the third then .

hello ,
my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to make a five day appointment with you .
and it would suit me in July from the twenty first to the twenty fifth .
hello ,
my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
unfortunately the date in July is impossible for me .
I could suggest a date in August though , from the third to the ninth , I would be free for five days then .
no , this does not suit me .
but it would be possible from the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth of August .
I am not free during this time as I have to go to Dresden then .
I could suggest to go from the thirty first of August to the eighth of September .
I would be free during this time .
this is also impossible for me but let us say from the thirtieth of August to the third of September .
I would be free then .
the thirtieth of August is not suitable for me .
the next would be from the tenth of September to the nineteenth , if we could put in five days then .
okay , let us say from the tenth of September to the fourteenth of September .
that suits me .
this would suit me fine , thank you .

hello ,
my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .

the holiday on the fifteenth of August does not suit me at all .
I have just noticed that the eighth of August would be possible for me .
I am booked then unfortunately .

this is not possible either , I will not be available then .
the last possibility would be the twenty ninth then .
that is all right with me , okay .
thank you .
hello ,
my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .

tomorrow , Friday the second , yes , that would actually suit me , that is okay .
I am very sorry , but I have just noticed that I already do have plans for Friday .
would Tuesday perhaps be suitable for you , that is after eleven $ A- $ M ?
unfortunately Tuesday is bad as I will not be in town then .
it actually should be during this week or even on the weekend , as I cannot make it before .
the weekend does suit me .
Saturday or Sunday for example .
let us take Saturday , shall we concentrate on Saturday ?
let us concentrate on Saturday .
thank you , goodbye .

I have thought to make an appointment during this week still .

five days
what about the eighth of October to the twelfth of October , a Tuesday ?
I am sorry , it is impossible for me because I have another appointment .
I could offer to meet in November ,
from Monday the twenty second to Friday the twenty sixth .
does this suit you ?
no , that does not suit me at all , November is bad .
either the end of October or the beginning of December , if you have some days then .
that suits me , that is okay .
let us fix that .

a Sunday in November would suit me very well .
I do not know if you mind to fix an appointment on a holiday .
usually generally I am free on every Sunday in November , which means that I can offer you the fourteenth ,
the twenty first or the twenty eighth .
if you could choose one of the days .
yes , both the twenty first and the twenty eighth would suit me .
I would prefer the twenty first .
can we fix this ?
is it okay ?

hello Mr Flex .
my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I have to disappoint you , it is pretty bad in October , my diary is totally full .
I would propose to postpone the trip to December around Christmas .
as we do not have to book very early , I would say to meet at the beginning of November for the preparations to talk about further details .
beginning of November is impossible for me before the fifth .
would that suit you ?
Mr Flex , I think the fifth of November will be sufficient . I have no time restrictions then .
could you propose a time when it suits you best ?
I would prefer around eight $ P- $ M .
is that okay ?
wonderful , Mr Flex .
I will see you Friday , the fifth of November at eight $ P- $ M .

my name is Niehmeyer $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
I would suggest that you propose a date as I have already got different appointments on every single day , except Thursday .
I see .
okay .
let me start to make a suggestion .
it should possibly be during this week or during next week .
I have just noticed that I cannot propose you any day during next week .
either tomorrow that is Tuesday the fifth ,
Wednesday the sixth or Thursday the seventh is fine with me .
please check which one of these days does suit you .
and then we can see if we can meet in the morning or in the afternoon .
on Tuesday we could meet after ten $ A- $ M ,
on Wednesday we could meet after one $ P- $ M and on Thursday we could meet before two $ P- $ M .
as we only have to meet for a short conference .
I would propose to meet on Tuesday already .
you said after ten $ P- $ M .
then I would propose to meet between eleven and twelve $ A- $ M .
let us meet on Tuesday , the fifth of October at eleven $ A- $ M at your place .
is that all right with you ?
yes , this is all right with me .
let me write this down .
then I will see you tomorrow at eleven $ A- $ M .
goodbye .
goodbye .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I would like to make a date with you to prepare the trip .
I think it will not take long .
when are you free ?
good evening .
my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N , and the second word , $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
let me see .
you want to make another appointment to prepare our trip .
let us check your calendar .
would it principally suit you on Wednesday the sixth ?
yes on Wednesday , the sixth of October I am free from one $ A- $ M on .
oh , from one $ P- $ M on .
this does suit me exactly .
you know , I have only time until two $ P- $ M .
let us meet at one $ P- $ M sharp then and talk about it quickly .
would that be all right with you ?
yes , excellent .
this does suit me very well .
and I think that one hour will be more than enough .
thank you .
I will see you on Wednesday .
good bye .
good bye .
hello ,
J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H speaking .
who is that speaking please ?
this is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R speaking .
I wanted to arrange a date for a five day working meeting in W &quot; urzburg .
when do you have time then ?
from the fourth on for example ?
yes , I have ,
in fact it would be possible until the ninth .
oh , sorry , I have just discovered , that I have got no more time after the eighth .
I would rather , we said from the eighteenth on .
well , I have got no time after the eighteenth unfortunately .
how about the twenty second of October perhaps ?
that is very inconvenient for me .
actually I am not available for five days running at that time in October .
how about November , from the twelfth on ?
unfortunately I have got no time then .
would it suit you , if we fixed a date for the time from the nineteenth on .
the nineteenth in inconvenient for me .
from the twenty second on , would that suit you ?
very badly , in fact I have got no time on Tuesday .
how about the end of November , that is from the twenty seventh on ?
the twenty seventh to the first of December ?
that would suit me .
okay ?
let us do it like that .
goodbye .
hello ,
this is Quell speaking ,
$ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
yes , hello ,
Walberg here ,
$ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
are you calling about a date for a Sunday in November for a business dinner .
yes , in fact I would have time on Sunday , the seventh of November .
no , I am booked up then unfortunately .
but I would have time on Sunday , the fourteenth of November .
I have got no time then unfortunately .
how about the twenty first , the Sunday before Advent .
I am also free then .
we could do it then .
okay , fine .
goodbye .
hello ,
this is Niehmeyer speaking ,
$ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
well , hello ,
this is K &quot; opp ,
$ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
I would like to have a date for a short meeting ,
within this week or at the beginning of the next week if possible .
well , how do you feel about the Tuesday , from nine $ A- $ M on ?
well , that is not bad .
so we could meet from nine $ A- $ M on .
fine , thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
hello ,
this is von Sudniz speaking ,
$ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I would like to arrange a date for the preparation of the trip .
well , hello ,
this is Flex speaking ,
$ F $ L $ E $ X .
yes , that would be possible .
at what time ?
how about from eleven o &apos;clock on ?
yes , that is okay .
at eleven $ A- $ M .
okay ,
thank you ,
goodbye .
hello , my name is J &quot; ansch .
who am I talking to , please ?
hello , my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
what do you want ?
yes ,
Mr G &quot; urtner ,
it is about a five day business seminar in Kiel ,
and I wanted to fix a date with you .
I simply make you a suggestion now .
for me it would be possible in June , from the fourth till the eighth of June , that is from Friday to Tuesday .
would that be possible for you ?
no , unfortunately not since I have an appointment on the seventh .
another suggestion for June , I would be free from the twenty first till the twenty fifth .
otherwise we would have to find a date that covers a weekend .
yes ,
then we will not be able to do without the weekends because for me it is not possible to become available on the twenty third .
perhaps in May , from Monday the seventeenth until Friday the twenty first , that would again be without a weekend .
would that be possible for you ?
no , unfortunately not , I have a date on the eighteenth .
my suggestion would be ,
but that would cover a weekend , that would be from the twenty first till the twenty fifth ,
a Tuesday .
unfortunately that is not possible for me .
let us go back to June ,
from Thursday the twenty fourth of June until the twenty eighth of June ,
that is a Monday .
could we agree on that ?
then I unfortunately have the problem that I have an appointment on the twenty sixth .
no I think that since we have already gone through June and , as it seems , there is very little time for me in May ,
I would say let us go to April .
no , I have several dates during that period .
it would be possible in April from the twenty fourth , that is a Saturday , until Wednesday the twenty eighth .
unfortunately that is not possible for me .
I already have a date from the twenty fourth till the twenty sixth .
my suggestion would be from the twenty seventh till the first of May .
again impossible for me .
how about the fifth of May and the following five days until the ninth ?
unfortunately I am already booked then .
now my suggestion would be from the nineteenth till the twenty third .
May or April ?
May .
the nineteenth until the twenty third .
yes , that is possible for me .
that is from Wednesday to Sunday .
am I right ?
correct .
yes , then let us fix from the nineteenth of May till the twenty third of May .
find . bye , Mrs J &quot; ansch .
hello , my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
who am I talking to , please ?
hello Mr Quell , this is Mrs Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
what is it about , please ?
it is about a business dinner on a Saturday in June .
I wanted to start right at the beginning ,
the fifth is not possible for me ,
therefore I suggest June the twelfth for a business dinner .
June the twelfth is unfortunately impossible for me , I would be completely free on the twenty sixth of June .
that would be possible .
on June the nineteenth I am only free until around six o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
then I think we must stay with the nineteenth since I obviously have a full calendar on the twenty sixth .
then I would say we will probably meet on the nineteenth at six o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
no , I am sorry you misunderstood me , I am only free until six o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
so on the nineteenth only lunch would be possible .
fine , then I would suggest let us fix a date for lunch .
let us say around half past twelve ?
yes , that suits me .
so I take it down .
let us fix Saturday the nineteenth at half past twelve .
yes , thank you , Mr Quell .
bye .
bye .
hello , my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
it is about a short meeting , a relatively short meeting which ,
however , would have to take place within this week or at the beginning of next week .
who am I talking to , please ?
hello , my name is Mr K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O double $ P .
yes , a date within this week .
what do you think about April the first ?
about April the first , that is a bit bad with me today .
is it possible for you tomorrow , on the second ?
unfortunately that is not possible for me .
perhaps we should first compare our calendars .
well , for me Monday is always completely free ,
Thursday is completely free , and apart from that Tuesday afternoon is free after two o &apos;clock ,
or Wednesday morning from nine till one o &apos;clock .
I would also be free on Friday after three o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
perhaps we go through your plan of the week first .
so when you say you are free on Monday that would be convenient .
we should get the whole thing over as soon as possible .
let us take Monday the fifth in the morning , as early as at nine o &apos;clock .
would that be possible ?
yes , that is possible for me , too , I am completely free then .
I would say let us keep the fifth and meet at nine o &apos;clock , as early as possible .
yes , fine .
so thanks a lot . bye .
bye .
hello , my name is von Sudniz , von and then $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
it is about an arbitrary date for travel preparations .
who am I talking to , please ?
hello , Mr von Sudniz , my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I would suggest as soon as possible .
I would prefer Monday or Thursday .
then it does not really matter which date we take .
I would even suggest perhaps the third of May in the early morning .
the third of May is unfortunately not possible for me .
but if you want to get it over as soon as possible I could offer you a date on April the fifth ,
I am still completely free on that Monday .
the fifth of April ?
yes , that would be possible for me , too .
let us stay with that .
and what time would suit you ?
as I already said , I am quite flexible .
I would suggest let us say around ten o &apos;clock .
around ten o &apos;clock .
and how long do you think that will last ?
I think we will not need longer than two hours .
fine , then I will put your name down .
on Monday the fifth of April from ten o &apos;clock until twelve thirty .
fine , thanks a lot .
bye .
yes , hello , my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
I would like to fix a date for a five day business meeting in Kiel .
who am I talking to anyway ?
yes , hello , my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
yes , when ?
when would a date suit you ?
when would you like to do it ?
for me it would be possible from Saturday the twenty fourth of April until Wednesday the twenty eighth of April .
I am very sorry , I already have another appointment then .
for me it would be best from the twenty seventh of April until the first of May .
May is very bad for me .
I can only offer you the fifth till the ninth of May .
yes , I am terribly sorry , I will then be at a conference again .
how about from ,
now I have to think .
for me it would again be possible on the twenty first of May ,
from the twenty first till the twenty sixth of May .
I am sorry , I have an appointment on the twenty fifth in the evening .
there is a bank holiday in between but as far as I am concerned we can do that .
that would unfortunately be a problem for me .
on Tuesday I have an appointment from three to seven o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
how about in June ?
June is basically good .
suggestion , fourth to eighth .
I am sorry but that is not possible for me .
how about from the eighth to the twelfth ?
here , Saturday is a problem for me .
then one week later from Monday the fourteenth until Friday the eighteenth of June would be great for me .
unfortunately I will be in Bochum on the seventeenth but from the eighteenth till the twenty second or the twenty third .
would that be okay ?
on Saturday I have appointments from seven to ten o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
the last offer I could make you would be the period between the twenty fourth and the thirtieth of June .
I am terribly sorry .
I have a very important date on the twenty sixth .
well , I think we somehow can not agree .
I must ask you again . the fifth till the ninth of May were not possible for you either ?
the fifth till the ninth of May unfortunately not , I have an appointment then .
well , I will not even be in Germany then , I will be abroad .
then , to be honest , I can not see a free date .
only , as I already mentioned , around Ascension day again .
the eighteenth till the twenty third for example .
Ascension day , the eighteenth till the twenty third .
yes , from the nineteenth till the twenty fourth .
would that be an offer ?
that is great .
then let us take the bank holiday , too , and we will have five days from the nineteenth till the twenty fourth .
okay .
yes , hi , hello , my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
who am I talking to , please ?
hello , this is J &quot; ansch speaking , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
when would it suit you ?
a Saturday in June .
I have appointments on June the twelfth and on June the nineteenth , on June the nineteenth from seven to ten o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
apart from that , I am free on the Saturdays in June .
now I must have a look .
that is a pity .
I would actually be off on the nineteenth and on the twelfth .
it is not possible for me on the fifth and on the twenty sixth .
that is really a pity .
do you really have no other free dates ?
well ,
we could say that on that nineteenth before seven o &apos;clock $ P- $ M I have , as I already mentioned ,
a date from seven to ten o &apos;clock ,
but if me would meet at five thirty ,
that should not be a problem .
well , Mr J &quot; ansch , we agree on this point , that would not be a problem for me .
let us simply say five thirty .
that is okay .
hello , my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
who am I talking to , please ?
yes , hi , hello , my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
hello ,
Mr K &quot; opp .
I would like to have an appointment for a short meeting within this week or at the beginning of next week .
how about , yes , tomorrow morning between nine and eleven o &apos;clock ?
do you mean April the second ?
well , that would not be a problem , I would have enough time from nine till twelve .
so that would be okay .
then let us fix ten o &apos;clock .
that is not too early , that is not too late .
I will come round at your place at ten o &apos;clock .
yes , I am grateful to you .
great , super .
yes , hi , hello , my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
who am I talking to , please ?
yes , hello , this is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
hello , Mr Flex .
I would like to fix a date with you for travel preparations some time this month , no matter when .
how about you ?
when would you prefer ?
what do you think of Monday morning , the fifth of April , around ten o &apos;clock ?
Mr Flex , we already agree , that was quick .
no problem , ten o &apos;clock .
I will come round to your place .
who am I talking to ?
Mrs G &quot; urtner is on the phone , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
yes , Mrs G &quot; urtner , this is about the following business .
I would need a date for a five day meeting in Kiel .
we definitely need these five days at a time and as soon as possible .
would that perhaps still be possible in April ?
I will just have a look at my calendar .
in April it is very bad .
that is five days at a time , am I right ?
yes , it definitely have to be five days at a time .
I could make you a suggestion , namely from the fifth , that is Monday the fifth until the ninth .
but there is also one bank holiday in between , that is Friday .
just to make sure , if you are talking of April , that is unfortunately not possible .
I have just seen on my own calendar that I will not be free before April the twentieth .
yes , how about the period between the twentieth and the twenty eighth ?
would you be free for five days at a time then ?
I will not be free from the twentieth to the twenty second and from the twenty fourth to the twenty sixth , I will be in Wiesbaden then .
so I would only be present on Friday the twenty third but that will not be of much use to you , will it ?
no , that alone is of no use to me .
listen , we must , however , do that as soon as possible .
what do you think about the beginning of May , from the fifth to the ninth of May ?
the fifth is a Monday .
that is exactly a period of time in which I really will not be here , exactly from Wednesday the fifth until Sunday the ninth .
but another suggestion , how about from the eighteenth until the twenty second of May ?
there is again a bank holiday in between .
perhaps that would not be bad .
fine , the bank holiday does not really matter to me .
we can do that .
shall we fix it like that ?
hello , my name is Quell .
I just spell that to you , $ Q $ U $ E double $ L .
who am I talking to , please ?
yes , hello .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
what is it about ?
it is about the following business .
it is about arranging with you a date for a business dinner on a Saturday in June .
could you make me a suggestion for a Saturday in June on which you would possibly be free ?
yes , well ,
there would be the first ,
but that is May the first ,
a bank holiday , on Saturday the eighth it would still be possible , afterwards it is again a little bad ,
it would only be possible again on the twenty second ,
if that does not get too late .
excuse me , did I say to you in May ?
it was about a Saturday in June .
oh yes , sorry , June .
yes , I could offer you the first , the fifth and then again the nineteenth .
the fifth is not possible for me but the nineteenth would be okay .
could we fix that ?
does it matter to you that on the nineteenth I am booked from seven to ten o &apos;clock $ P- $ M ?
then we would possibly have to do it after nine or ten o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
certainly that would not be a problem .
but can we fix it like that ?
fine , we can do that .
yes , hello ,
my name is Niehmeyer ,
I shortly spell that for you ,
$ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
who am I talking to , please ?
Mrs K &quot; opp is on the phone .
I also spell that for you , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
fine ,
Mrs K &quot; opp ,
it is about the following business ,
we still need a date for a short meeting within this week or at the beginning of next week .
yes , what could you suggest ?
well ,
the second and the third would be possible , I am not available on the fourth ,
or then the fifth and the sixth .
yes ,
well , tomorrow ,
on the second , I have just seen that I am unfortunately not available from one to four o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
could we do that before one o &apos;clock ?
how about the third ?
I am sorry , the third is not possible for me at all .
but as a further possibility you have been talking about the fifth , I remember .
I have been talking about the fifth , that is right , I would actually be free the whole day then .
great , I am also free the whole day then .
then let us fix that .
let us say right in the morning at nine .
fine , then let us fix that .
I will keep that in mind , in the morning at nine .
hello ,
my name is von Sudniz ,
I just spell that to you ,
so it is a normal von ,
then $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
it is about arranging a date with you for travel preparations .
as far as I am concerned , the date does not really matter .
could you make any suggestions ?
yes , hello , by the way you are talking to Mr Flex .
I just spell that to you , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
about a date for travel preparations , you said .
well , this week it is not possible for me on Saturday and ,
yes ,
on Tuesday from three to six o &apos;clock I am also booked as I can see .
from Thursday onwards I will be away again .
it will probably be a bit difficult to find a date that suits both of us .
I will not , for example , be here the whole day on Sunday ,
then on Tuesday from nine to two o &apos;clock ,
on Wednesday from two to six o &apos;clock and on Friday from nine to three o &apos;clock .
did I understand you correctly that you would already be here on Monday ?
Monday is okay , I actually have the whole day at my disposal .
could you possibly suggest a time ?
yes , that suits me perfectly .
let us say in the afternoon at one o &apos;clock ?
that suits me .
fine , then let us fix it like that .
hello ,
my name is J &quot; ansch ,
$ J $ A umlaut $ S $ C $ H ,
and I would like to arrange with you a five day business meeting in Hannover .
yes , hello , my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
now it is the question when it would be convenient .
I have just seen that the second half of September would suit me best .
I would be free between the tenth and nineteenth .
I will be at your disposal from the ninth to the seventeenth .
yes ,
then I would suggest from the thirteenth ,
that is a Monday in September ,
until the seventeenth ,
including the seventeenth ,
that is a Friday .
yes , fine , that would be one working week .
we can do it like that and meet in Hannover then .
fine , we will do it like that .
yes , hello , my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
I would like to arrange a date with you on a Sunday in August ,
and the first and third Sunday would suit me .
hello , my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
the third Sunday is , I think , the twenty second , that would also be possible for me .
the third Sunday , that was a misunderstanding , is the fifteenth because the month begins with the first .
so for me that would be the first and the fifteenth of August .
on the twenty third I unfortunately have another date .
one week later , the twenty ninth , would again be convenient for me .
I am neither free on the first nor on the fifteenth .
the last Sunday , the twenty ninth , would be possible .
okay , then let us meet then .
we can still talk about the time .
bye .
bye .
hello ,
my name is Niehmeyer ,
$ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R ,
and I would like to fix a date with you for a short meeting ,
still within this week or at the beginning of next week .
yes , then , hello , my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
it would suit me on Friday or at the weekend , on Friday unfortunately not , but on Tuesday after eleven .
on Tuesday I will be in Hamburg .
then I think it is best if we do it tomorrow , that is July the second , that is a Friday .
if that would be possible with you I would suggest this date then .
unfortunately I have appointments the whole day on Friday .
today I would still be free the whole day .
yes , then it would still be possible today .
fine , okay , then we can telephone again this afternoon .
yes , hello , my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N , new word , $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I would like to fix a date with you in order to discuss travel preparations .
when would it suit you ?
I must have a short look .
yes , for me it will not be possible before Monday the fifth .
my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
yes , Monday is very bad for me because I will be in D &quot; usseldorf then .
for me it is possible again on Tuesday from eleven onwards or on Wednesday afternoon from three onwards .
well , I will be the whole week in Hamburg , from Tuesday until Friday .
it would be possible again , yes , from the twelfth onwards .
that is a Monday .
on the twelfth I will still be away but I will be back again on Tuesday , from eleven o &apos;clock onwards ,
as already mentioned .
perhaps we can meet on Tuesday afternoon .
on Tuesday I will be in a meeting between twelve and six o &apos;clock .
we could only meet on Tuesday evening or , if you have the time , on Wednesday .
Wednesday morning between nine and ten would be very nice ,
or Tuesday evening from six or seven onwards , depending on what you prefer .
then I would suggest let us take Wednesday .
Wednesday , I think you said ten o &apos;clock .
then let us take Wednesday , ten o &apos;clock .
from nine to ten .
at ten I unfortunately have dates again .
or Wednesday afternoon .
then I would suggest nine o &apos;clock .
then we will start at nine o &apos;clock , if it suits you .
yes , the meeting should not take so long because I must go somewhere else at ten .
okay , bye .
bye .
yes , hello , this is G &quot; urtner speaking , I spell it , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to arrange a date with you for a five day business meeting in Hannover .
could you perhaps suggest a date ?
hello , Mr G &quot; urtner , this is Mr J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
how is that for you ?
I am sorry but in July I am already totally booked .
I could possibly suggest you a date in August , that is from the third till the eleventh ,
apart from that I am totally booked in August .
August is not so good for me since I will be at a seminar from the third to the eighth ,
but from Tuesday the twenty fourth onwards a five day meeting will be possible for me again .
what could you do then ?
I am sorry , then we have to cancel August , too .
but perhaps in September .
well , in September I would be free from the first to the twenty fourth , more or less without breaks .
that is good because I will also be free from the ninth of the seventeenth .
then I would say let us have our meeting in this period .
does that suit you best ?
yes , then I would suggest let us take the whole normal week from the thirteenth to the seventeenth .
then we would have five days in the normal course of the week .
that is a very good suggestion .
I would say we leave it like that and fix our date from the thirteenth to the seventeenth .
should anything change we will contact each other again .
fine , thank you .
bye .
I thank you , too .
hello , this is Mr Walberg of the Bayerische Landesbank here in Munich speaking .
I shortly spell my name ,
$ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G ,
and I call you because of the business dinner that we have planned for August .
now I would , of course , have to know on which Sunday in August you are free .
yes , hello , this is Quell speaking .
I also spell shortly , $ Q $ U $ E double $ L .
as a first date I could offer you Sunday the eighth .
what would you think of that ?
Sunday the eighth is very bad for me since I will be the whole week through ,
starting on the third , at a conference and so this date is not possible for me .
for me it would be possible on the fifteenth ,
that is the day of the assumption of the Virgin Mary as I have just seen .
how is that for you ?
I am sorry but that is very bad ,
from the thirteenth to the seventeenth I am totally booked ,
I will be on a longer trip and will not come back before the seventeenth .
yes , that is again bad for me , of course .
Sunday the twenty second is not possible for me at all .
then only Sunday the twenty ninth remains .
I hope you are free on that date .
yes , great .
we can do that , of course , I am still free on that date .
then I would say let us fix that straight away and leave it like that .
okay ,
then let us leave the date on the twenty ninth and yes ,
I will take that down and should anything change I will contact you again .
fine , bye .
thanks a lot .
yes , hello , this is K &quot; opp .
I spell it shortly ,
$ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P ,
and I would like to fix a date with you ,
preferably a short meeting within this week but possibly also at the beginning of next week .
today is , as you know , July the first , and yes , when could you make a suggestion ?
hello , Mr K &quot; opp , this is Niehmeyer speaking , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
well , things are for me as follows , it would still be possible today or actually any day till Sunday .
so if you are free any time then , we could arrange something .
yes , what date could you suggest me ?
well , today it is unfortunately only possible until two o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
afterwards I am booked .
that is actually relatively good since I do not have any fixed dates today .
would it be possible to meet right now or within the next one or two hours ?
great .
then I would suggest that we perhaps meet at twelve o &apos;clock for a small snack in the cafeteria opposite from here ,
and then we could perhaps talk about these important things quickly .
yes , that is exactly what we will do , and I would say we will see each other at twelve then .
bye .
bye , thanks a lot .
yes , hello , this is Mr Flex speaking .
I spell it shortly , $ F $ L $ E $ X , and I am calling you because of the date for our travel preparations .
now , when would you be free or which day of the week would actually suit you best ?
yes , hello , Mr Flex , this is von Sudniz .
we already know each other .
I also spell it shortly , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
what could you offer in July ?
now I would say as early as within this week .
this week it is actually only possible for me at the weekend since I am completely booked on Friday .
how about the weekend ?
yes , now on Saturday I would really be free .
then I would say we will have our meeting perhaps on Saturday and can then fix the most important details .
Saturday is very good .
but it is only possible for me in the afternoon since in the morning I have to go shopping .
I would say could we perhaps meet on Saturday at two o &apos;clock $ P- $ M ?
then I can really see no problems .
I am free on Saturday and I actually have not got any further dates .
then I would say let us leave it like that .
fine , will you come to my place on Saturday at two o &apos;clock $ P- $ M or shall we meet at a neutral place .
I do not care .
I would say you will come to my place , we will have coffee and cakes and discuss the individual details .
okay , let us do it like that .
now the details on Saturday then , and I will come to your place .
bye .
fine , thank you , bye .

for the second half of the month of August .

yes ,
my name is J &quot; ansch ,
$ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H ,

we can do it like that .

my name is Walberg ,
$ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G ,
and I would like to arrange a date with you on a Sunday in August for a business dinner .
I will suggest dates straight away .
for me it would be possible on August the first , the fifteenth and the twenty ninth .
perhaps you would be free on one of these days .

we could fix a date for a business dinner then .
okay , then let us fix that . the twenty ninth .
thank you .
hello , my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
I would like to arrange a date for a short meeting within this week or at the beginning of next week .
my suggestions for this date would be Friday the second of July or Saturday next week , that would be the tenth of July .
would you agree to one of these dates ?
yes , unfortunately that is not possible .
hello , by the way , my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
it is never possible for me on Friday , and I already have a date on Saturday .
yes ,
now for me it is also possible on Tuesday from eleven onwards or on Wednesday from three $ P- $ M onwards , or the whole day on Monday or the whole day on Thursday .
perhaps we can take another date .
when would it be possible for you on Wednesday ?
on Wednesday it is possible for me from three o &apos;clock $ P- $ M until , yes , open end .
then we can only make a compromise and meet the week after next week , on Wednesday the fourteenth of July .
can you please tell me a date for that day ?
that depends when you are free .
well , I am already busy from three to seven o &apos;clock $ P- $ M and from ten to three anyway .
so that means I will only be free until ten o &apos;clock and after seven o &apos;clock $ P- $ M , so really not at all .
okay , let us meet from nine till ten .
that will be enough for the short meeting .
okay .
hello ,
my name is Flex ,
$ F $ L $ E $ X and I would like to arrange a date with you to prepare our trip ,
and I would prefer July ,
so this month ,
between the twentieth and the thirty first .
if possible on a Monday or Thursday .
would you be free some time then ?
Ms Flex , hello .
my name is von Sudniz , I spell it , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
the dates you mentioned suit me partially .
Thursday the twenty seventh of July would be possible but not before one $ P- $ M , please .
could we arrange something then ?
yes , we can do that .
at one $ P- $ M .
that is okay .
hello , my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to fix a date with you for a five days business dinner in Hannover .
yes , hello ,
my name is J &quot; ansch ,
$ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H ,
and which date would you prefer ?
for me July the fourteenth would be possible , Wednesday the fourteenth of July until the eighteenth , a Sunday .
yes , I am sorry , that is not possible for me , I have already got a very important date then .
how about July the twentieth , a Tuesday ?
unfortunately that is not possible . the next possible date for me would be August the third .
yes , I am sorry , I have already got an important date then .
perhaps , yes , on August the twenty fourth I would be free again , that would be a Tuesday .
I am sorry but that is again not possible for me .
then the thirty first of August .
I would only be free for three days then .
the next possible date for me would be September then ninth , that is a Thursday .
no , that is unfortunately again not possible for me . perhaps on the tenth ?
perhaps on the tenth ?
yes , the tenth would be possible .
very well .
then let us fix the tenth , see you then .
that is okay .
hello ,
my name is Walberg ,
$ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G ,
and I would like to find a Sunday in August with you on which we could have a business dinner together .
hello , my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L , and I would suggest to have dinner on August the eighth .
I am sorry , on August the eighth I will be coming back from a seminar late at night .
how is the day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary for you , that is August the fifteenth ?
I am sorry but I will not be free again before August the twenty second .
I am sorry but I will not be free then .
then the only possibility left would be the twenty ninth .
how is that for you ?
the twenty ninth would be very good thanks a lot .
hello ,
my name is K &quot; opp ,
$ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P and I would like to fix a date with you for a short meeting within this week or at the beginning of next week ,
that means at the beginning of July , today is July the first , or next week .
hello ,
my name is Niehmeyer ,
$ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R ,
and a meeting would be possible for me today or on Saturday .
today would also be good for me , but only in the morning .
yes , that is quite convenient , then let us do it today .
would ten o &apos;clock suit you ?
very well .
ten o &apos;clock would be okay .
hello ,
my name is Flex ,
$ F $ L $ E $ X and I will now try to find a date together with you for the travel preparations .
I suggest straight away July the twentieth , that is a Tuesday .
hello ,
my name is von Sudniz ,
$ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z ,
and on the twentieth it is unfortunately not possible for me .
therefore I suggest the twenty first .
but then it is only possible until five o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
yes , that would be okay for me .
okay , then let us fix July the twenty first , Wednesday the twenty first of July .
around three o &apos;clock $ P- $ M , would that suit you ?
yes , I would prefer a quarter past three because I have a date until three o &apos;clock .
very well .
then it is a quarter past three .
see you then .
bye .
hello , my name is Mr G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to arrange a date with you for a five day business meeting in W &quot; urzburg .
could you please tell me your name ?
yes , hello , my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
and I would be free for this five day meeting in October from the twenty third to the twenty seventh .
yes , I am also free from the twenty third to the twenty seventh of October , we could meet then .
I have just seen that it is not possible for me after all , I do have a one and a half hour date during that period .
would it also suit you in November from the twenty second till the twenty sixth ?
I am sorry , from the twenty second to the twenty sixth I have got another date in Schwerin .
I would be free at the beginning of November from the fourth to the ninth .
I am sorry but it is not possible for me then .
my suggestion would be perhaps from the twelfth to the seventeenth .
I am sorry but I will be busy from the twelfth to the seventeenth , too . that is not possible for me either .
it would be possible for me in October from the eighth to the thirteenth .
well , I am awfully sorry but unfortunately I will be in Dresden then .
but perhaps we could arrange it , how about in December , from the seventeenth onwards ?
it would only be till the twenty second .
in December it would only be possible for me from the twelfth to the seventeenth .
so that is not possible for me again . that is a terrible situation .
how about the weekend of the first Sunday in advent , that is from the twenty fifth to the twenty ninth of November .
for me it is not possible before the twenty seventh of November because I will be in Schwerin before then .
we could perhaps ,
I think ,
still in October ,
we already had that ,
from the twenty fifth to the thirtieth . I do not know if you are free then .
well , I would like to get back to November now .
if you are free from the twenty seventh on , I would be free until December , from the twenty seventh to the second .
how about that ?
yes ,
in this period it would also be possible for me ,
from the twenty seventh till the second of December ,
no problem .
I am very happy about that .
yes , hello ,
my name is Walberg ,
$ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G ,
and I would like to fix a date with you for a business dinner .
hello , my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
I would also be interested in a business dinner on a Sunday in November .
I could suggest you Sunday the seventh of November if you would be free .
yes , Mr Quell , I am sorry but I do not have time on the seventh .
for me it would be possible on the fourteenth , and it would also be possible on the twenty first and the twenty eighth .
please tell me on which of the three Sundays you are free .
yes , it is nice that you offered me several dates .
I would for example be free on Sunday the twenty first if that suits you .
Mr Quell , that would suit me .
let us fix the twenty first .
thanks a lot .
hello , my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
I would like to see you for a short meeting .
it would suit me best within this week or at the beginning of next week .
since today is Monday the fourth of October , I would like to ask you if you are perhaps free on Monday .
I will be free the whole week except for Thursday from two to eight o &apos;clock $ P- $ M , I will not be free then .
could you tell me if you are free then ? thanks .
yes , hello Mr K &quot; opp , my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
yes , a date for a short meeting .
well ,
of course it would be possible for me today ,
namely between twelve and one ,
or between one and two .
that suits me .
since I still have not got any dates today we could meet between one and two o &apos;clock .
yes , Mr K &quot; opp , let us meet between one and two o &apos;clock .
I would like to meet with you within the next months in order to prepare our trip .
hello , my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
I would like to meet you .
I could suggest you a few dates .
how would , for example , October suit you , I think as soon as possible , on October the ninth ?
the time does not really matter to me .
Mr von Sudniz , I am sorry but on October the ninth I will be in Dresden .
I agree with you ,
would it perhaps be possible tomorrow ,
at ,
let us say ,
tomorrow around ten o &apos;clock ?
yes , that is not problem .
I have not got any dates tomorrow .
I would like to meet you tomorrow , on Tuesday , at ten o &apos;clock .
that is really great , Mr Sudniz .
yes , hello , here is Mrs G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to arrange a date with you for a five day business meeting in W &quot; urzburg .
yes , hello , Mr G &quot; urtner , J &quot; ansch is my name , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
yes , that suits me .
we only have to agree on a date .
well , in the middle or at the end of November it would not be bad for me .
that does not suit me at all because there will be very many dates then .
is not it possible for you at the end of October ?
no , I am sorry but the end of October does not suit me at all .
how about the beginning of December , until the fourteenth ?
I would actually be relatively free then .
the beginning of December would also be possible for me .
especially the first five days in December , perhaps Wednesday till Sunday ?
well , Sunday is bad .
if we started as early as on Tuesday and went on until Saturday we would also have five days .
you mean starting on November the thirtieth ?
yes , exactly .
yes , that would also suit me .
then let us fix that .
thanks a lot .
yes ,
hello , my name is Walberg ,
$ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G ,
and I would like to arrange a date with you for a business dinner ,
and a Sunday in November would be quite convenient for me .
yes , hello , my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
I would have three days in November to choose between , the seventh , the twenty first and the twenty eighth .
yes , then let us take the first Sunday in advent , shall not we ?
the first Sunday in advent , the twenty eighth of November ? yes , that also suits me .
yes , hello , my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
I would like to fix a date with you for a short meeting ,
if possible within this week or at the beginning of next week .
yes , hello , my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
yes , I would prefer this week , and I am still free on Tuesday or Wednesday morning .
Tuesday morning is only possible after ten o &apos;clock , Wednesday morning is very inconvenient .
yes , then we can arrange something on Tuesday between ten and two o &apos;clock ?
yes , that would also suit me .
hello , my name is Flex ,
$ F $ L $ E $ X ,
and I wanted to fix a date with you in order to prepare the trip .
yes , my name is von Sudniz , $ V $ O $ N $ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z .
what time were you thinking of ?
is it possible for you as early as this month , in October ?
yes , that would be possible .
for example at the end of October I will be off a lot .
apart from that between the fifteenth and the eighteenth .
yes , how about the eighteenth in the morning , before four o &apos;clock $ P- $ M ?
no , that is very inconvenient for me . I have just seen that I will be busy until four o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
and on the day after , on Tuesday the nineteenth , again before two o &apos;clock $ P- $ M ?
I will not be in town then . insofar we would have to postpone it to the twenty second or even later .
then that will get later after all .
on the twenty second I will not be here either .
what would suit you then , the week of the twenty sixth , twenty seventh , twenty eighth ?
Thursday the twenty eighth , for example , would be very convenient for me .
yes , that would be relatively tight .
well , it would have to be squeezed in somewhere between two and half past three $ P- $ M .
then let us say Wednesday after one o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
yes , fine .
if we finish by two o &apos;clock $ P- $ M , then that is okay .
that seems to me to be a bit difficult .
how about Thursday , after ten o &apos;clock ?
that is very good .
thanks .
hello , my name is G &quot; urtner , $ G $ &quot; U $ R $ T $ N $ E $ R .
I would like to arrange with you a date for a five days business meeting in W &quot; urzburg .
yes , so I also introduce myself shortly , my name is J &quot; ansch , $ J $ &quot; A $ N $ S $ C $ H .
well , in October it is not possible for me , it would have to be November .
how about from the twenty second to the twenty sixth ?
I am sorry but it is not possible for me from the twenty second to the twenty sixth , I will be away then .
how about from the fifth to the ninth of November ?
unfortunately that is not possible for me .
but we could make it from the twelfth to the eighteenth .
I am sorry but I will also be away from the twelfth to the eighteenth of November .
how is December for you ?
how about the second week , from the sixth till the tenth ?
could we start one day earlier from the fifth to the ninth ?
no , I am sorry but it is not possible for me on the fifth .
could we meet in the week from the eleventh to the fifteenth ?
no , I am sorry but that is not possible for me .
but we could try it from the nineteenth to the twenty fourth .
it would be possible for me from the twentieth to the twenty fifth .
that is good , that is possible for me , too .
then let us do it over the bank holidays .
fine , yes , okay .
hello , my name is Walberg .
I would like to invite you for a business dinner on a Sunday in November .
when would you be free ?
hello , my name is Quell , $ Q $ U $ E $ L $ L .
what was your name ?
I did not get it exactly .
my name is Walberg , $ W $ A $ L $ B $ E $ R $ G .
on a Sunday in November for a business dinner .
no , I am sorry but that is not possible for me .
but how about the end , on the twenty eighth ?
on the twenty eighth it would also suit me .
okay , see you then .
hello , my name is K &quot; opp , $ K $ &quot; O $ P $ P .
I would like to see you this week for a short meeting .
yes , that is possible .
my name is Niehmeyer , $ N $ I $ E $ H $ M $ E $ Y $ E $ R .
but I am only free until Thursday .
I would be free on Monday from four to seven o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
how would that be for you ?
yes , fine .
then let us meet today .
fine , see you then . bye .
hello , my name is Flex , $ F $ L $ E $ X .
I would like to invite you this week to a short meeting for our travel preparations .
when would you be free ?
hello ,
my name is von Sudniz ,
$ S $ U $ D $ N $ I $ Z ,
and I would for example be free on Thursday from ten o &apos;clock on .
great , that is perfect for me .
fine , then let us meet on Tuesday at ten o &apos;clock .
see you then .
agreed .
so , our meeting .
how would Monday the twenty fourth at eight suit you ?
yes , eight o &apos;clock is a bit tight because I have got another meeting at ten .
I would prefer Monday .
Monday afternoon is very bad .
Tuesday would suit me better .
I have got again some meetings then .
well , Tuesday is actually out of the question .
I would prefer Wednesday or Thursday then .
on Wednesday and Thursday I have got a seminar the whole day , on Friday , too .
Monday the thirty first in the morning would be good .
perhaps we would have to agree on Wednesday .
Wednesday afternoon .
does that suit you ?
Wednesday the second of June .
I have got a business lunch from twelve to two but afterwards it would suit me perfectly .
then perhaps you misunderstood me .
I meant Wednesday the twenty sixth .
on Wednesday the second of June I will be away again .
I will not be back before Thursday .
no , these dates , as I already said , are not possible for me because I have got a seminar .
so that was Monday the thirty first , that was impossible , too .
Tuesday the first of June or , as I said , Wednesday morning the second of June .
well , as I said , you cannot contact me till the third of June .
it would be possible for me on the third , that would be Thursday .
so , in the afternoon it would not be a problem for me .
for example at two $ P- $ M .
Thursday the third of June , two $ P- $ M .
great , see you then .
see you then .
so , now it is about the next appointment .
how about Thursday the twenty ninth of July in the morning ?
Thursday morning is bad for me , in the afternoon it would be possible .
if Thursday is not possible , I will be away from Friday till Tuesday .
and then again on Wednesday early in the morning or in the afternoon , the fourth of August .
yes ,
then I would say let us fix it on Wednesday , again at two $ P- $ M . so on the fourth of August at two $ P- $ M .
great , I have taken a note of it .
Wednesday , two $ P- $ M .
so , now concerning our next meeting .
would Monday afternoon the twenty seventh of September suit you ?
actually that does not suit me at all because I have got another meeting then , just as on Tuesday and Wednesday .
Thursday is bad , too .
it would perhaps suit me on the seventh of October .
well , that is a little late , too .
no , I would suggest on Wednesday the twenty ninth in the afternoon .
on Wednesday I have got a seminar .
that would not suit me at all .
on Friday I would have a lot of time , except from ten to eleven because I have got a meeting then .
that was Thursday the thirtieth . yes that is also packed for me .
or did you mean Friday ?
that is actually also packed , although I could find some time for a short meeting on Friday .
yes , we should take some more time .
how about Monday afternoon the fourth of October ?
I am sorry but I will be away from the fourth to the sixth .
and on the seventh and eighth , too , I have got a seminar from ten in the morning till late at night .
that is ,
only Friday the first would really be possible ,
or at short notice in September ,
from the twenty seventh till the thirtieth .
well okay , then let us have a short meeting on Friday the first .
perhaps it will be enough for us .
so see you on Friday at eleven .
so we have fixed Friday the first of October from eleven to twelve thirty . I will be free then .
well , we should also fix a date for our next meeting .
okay , I will be away on the twenty fifth , twenty sixth and twenty seventh .
well , I would prefer if we made it earlier , for example on the twenty second in the morning .
the twenty second in the morning is very bad for me , I have got a lecture from nine till twelve .
Tuesday morning at eight $ A- $ M or three $ P- $ M would suit me .
yes , then I would simply suggest to make in on Tuesday morning at ten o &apos;clock , on the twenty third .
that does not work because I have got another meeting at ten .
now I want to have a look , Wednesday afternoon at four would be possible .
that is the only possible date on Wednesday .
Thursday is bad .
perhaps Friday morning or afternoon .
as I already said I will be away on Friday .
but on Wednesday the twenty fourth we could meet at four $ P- $ M .
that would be possible .
okay , Wednesday afternoon , four $ P- $ M .
hello Christian , how are you ?
we must find a new date .
when will you be free ?
on the seventh of April I will be away .
I have got no time then .
how about the ninth of April ?
that is a Friday .
on the ninth of April I have got a meeting from three to four $ P- $ M .
but I would be free in the morning .
fine , then we can meet in the morning from ten to eleven thirty .
okay , ten to eleven thirty is good .
okay . let us fix the date on the ninth of April .
Friday , ten to eleven thirty .
see you on the ninth of April then .
bye .
okay . goodbye .
hello Martin . how about fixing our next meeting on February the third at nine o &apos;clock ?
hello Christian .
on February the third I have got a meeting from nine thirty till twelve o &apos;clock .
but I will be free in the afternoon .
I am sorry but in the afternoon I have got a meeting from one to two .
if necessary I would only be free later , that is at three o &apos;clock .
on Wednesday the third of February I could arrange the meeting at three o &apos;clock .
fine , then let us fix the appointment on Wednesday , February the third at three $ P- $ M .
then everything is clear . bye .
hello Christian .
how about Wednesday the second of June ?
I have got a business lunch from twelve to two , but before that I would be free .
Wednesday the second of June is very bad for me .
I will be away the whole day then .
and on Thursday the third of June ?
that would be possible .
I have only got a meeting from ten to eleven o &apos;clock and I will be free for the rest of the day .
on Thursday the third of June I have got a meeting from nine thirty until ten but in the afternoon we could have our meeting at three o &apos;clock .
as far as I am concerned we can do it like that .
so it is the third of June , Thursday , three $ P- $ M .
see you then .
hello Martin . how about fixing our next meeting on Thursday the twenty ninth of July at nine o &apos;clock ?
hello Christian . I do not want that date .
that would suit me .
on Wednesday the fourth of August I have only got a meeting from nine to eleven and I will be free in the afternoon .
then let us fix our meeting for Wednesday the fourth of August at three $ P- $ M .
hello Christian .
on Wednesday the sixth of October I would be free the whole day .
how about you ?
the sixth of October does not suit me at all , I will be away the whole day .
but how about Friday the eighth of October at nine o &apos;clock ?
I do have a meeting on Friday the eighth of October from eleven thirty to twelve thirty but we could have our meeting from nine to eleven thirty .
nine to eleven thirty would be quite bad since I have got a seminar from ten to five .
therefore let us find another day for it .
will you be free on Tuesday the twenty eighth of September ?
I will be free at twelve for the rest of the day .
I am sorry but on Tuesday the twenty eighth of September I have got a business lunch from twelve to two and a meeting from three to five .
so we can not have our meeting then .
how about in the morning ?
on Tuesday the twenty eighth of September I have got a lecture from nine to twelve .
therefore we should better take another date .
how about Tuesday the fifth of October ?
I do have a lecture from nine to twelve but apart from that I will be free the whole day .
on that day I will be away the whole day , just like on the fourth , fifth and sixth of October .
then let us take Friday the eighth of October .
I do have a meeting from eleven thirty till twelve thirty but apart from that I will be free the whole day .
fine .
we would only have to confine ourselves to the period from nine to ten o &apos;clock since I have got another seminar on Friday from ten to five .
okay .
let us have our meeting on Friday the eighth of October from nine to ten .
does it suit you on the twenty fifth , on no ,
that does not suit me at all ,
I have got a lot of appointments then .
will you be free on Tuesday the twenty sixth ?
Tuesday afternoon ?
Thursday afternoon is bad .
late afternoon would be convenient .
at a quarter past four .
let us say a quarter past four .
okay , agreed .
as a date for our next meeting .
how about Monday the twenty sixth at , no , that lasts until four thirty .
I have got no time then .
oh .
Wednesday the twenty eighth at two $ P- $ M .
I am sorry , I have got a meeting then .
but how about , oh yes , our meeting takes perhaps two hours .
how about the twenty ninth at , say , two $ P- $ M ?
no , that is not possible .
I have got a meeting till four $ P- $ M .
that will be too tight for me .
but on Friday ,
I have just seen that I have got no appointment at all .
will you be free on Friday the thirtieth ?
I am sorry .
on this day I am completely booked .
then we must , after all , go to August .
how about the fourth of August at two $ P- $ M ?
two $ P- $ M .
yes , I will be free then .
let us fix our date then .
okay .
we should fix a date in September , if possible .
does the twenty seventh of September suit you , at , say , two $ P- $ M ?
that is totally out of the question .
I am booked till four $ P- $ M then , and afterwards there probably will not be enough time .
but on Wednesday the twenty ninth I would be free in the afternoon .
does that suit you ?
when in the afternoon , please ?
oh , I am completely flexible .
I have only got an appointment at twelve .
for me it would not be possible before four thirty .
that means it would only be possible if the meeting was very short .
I think we should not get into a time pressure .
how about Thursday at a quarter past two ?
that is totally out of the question . I am completely booked that day .
I am sorry but that is not possible .
the beginning of October is very bad .
I will be away till the sixth .
on the seventh I have got a seminar till five and on the eighth , too .
oh dear .
what shall we do about it ?
is it really not possible in September ?
yes , perhaps we should go to Saturday the second of October .
does that suit you ?
yes , if that is possible .
I have only got a business lunch till one o &apos;clock .
fine , then let us take the second of October .
let us say two $ P- $ M .
that is a bit tight . rather two thirty .
is that okay ?
okay .
hello , Mrs M &quot; uller , with reference to our last telephone call I wanted to fix a date for a meeting .
how about the first week in August ?
I have to look .
no ,
that is no possible at all , I have got lectures and a conference the whole week .
how about the third week of August ?
the seventeenth , that is a Tuesday .
Tuesday . yes .
however , I have got a conference from one to six $ P- $ M .
so it would be possible in the morning .
Tuesday is no problem at all for me , I am free the whole day .
suggest a time then .
I would say nine thirty in our main building , in the conference room .
that suits me perfectly .
so nine o &apos;clock , I will have this taken down , and if anything should change I will tell you before then .
bye then .
hello , Mr H &quot; ubsch .
I would like to fix a date with you in June , for a meeting .
in the first week of June I am on holiday .
that is not at all good for me , I have got a training on Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday .
Friday in the second week in June would be free .
Friday , I first have to have a look .
no , that is not so good , we have got a sales discussion then .
then how about in the second week of June on Thursday or Friday ?
well , we have got several meetings before .
that is not good at all .
on Thursday morning I have got a meeting from nine to eleven .
apart from that , I would suggest Thursday afternoon at two o &apos;clock .
and then it is best if you come to your place , to my office and then we have enough time to discuss everything .
does that suit you ?
June .
bye .
good morning , Mrs M &quot; uller .
I would like to fix a date with you for our next conference .
in the first week of March I will be on holiday .
how about the beginning of the second week of March ?
hello Mr H &quot; ubsch . now the second week of March is very bad for me ,
first I have got a meeting and then in the middle of the week an appointment with my doctor .
but how about the third week of March on Wednesday ?
that is the seventeenth .
I would be free then , apart from that I am busy the whole week .
oh must not I speak so long
what is happening
yes , Wednesday in the third week of March .
I am sorry but I have got a seminar then from nine to four thirty .
then we would have to postpone our conference until the end of the working day and I think that would not be so convenient .
on Friday , oh you said you
yes , then in the third week of March I will be free from Monday till Friday .
you can suggest a date .
perhaps right on Monday .
that would be the twenty second of March .
then I would say Monday morning at eight o &apos;clock .
then we have got enough time and can have a cup of coffee together for breakfast if that suits you .
we still have to fix a date in March for our next meeting .
yes , I would prefer Wednesday .
around five $ P- $ M perhaps .
how about the beginning of March ? on Monday or Tuesday , that would be the first and the second of March ?
well , Tuesday is not possible for me at all .
I have got lectures and will be away then .
Monday would be best .
on Monday .
what time would suit you ?
it would suit me at five $ P- $ M .
yes , five $ P- $ M would be okay .
see you in March at five $ P- $ M .
okay , see you then .
yes , hello .
we still have to fix a date in April .
when would it suit you ?
it would be best in the middle of April , in the eighteenth week .
yes , then I suggest Monday in the eighteenth week .
yes , at what time ?
Monday , that would be the nineteenth of April , it would only be possible in the morning .
oh , I am wrong , I am on holiday then .
I propose Friday at six $ P- $ M .
very bad .
that is not possible at all .
how about Wednesday the twenty first of April ?
no , Wednesday is not possible at all .
how about Friday at five thirty ?
which Friday do you mean ?
the thirtieth or
yes , I would be free on Friday the thirtieth .
Friday the thirtieth around two $ P- $ M ?
yes , that is okay .
let us leave it at two $ P- $ M on Friday the thirtieth .
we wanted to fix a date in May .
a business meeting , of course .
yes , fine .
well , I would prefer the twenty first , on Friday the twenty first .
in the morning or late in the evening .
it would be possible at five thirty .
but I would prefer the sixth of May .
that is a Thursday .
no , that is not possible at all , I will be on holiday then , sailing .
so then I would prefer Thursday the twenty seventh .
yes , that would also be possible . but only after ten thirty .
but actually I would prefer at eleven .
okay , that would suit me .
yes , and now we really should fix a date at last .
but I must tell you that I have got no time in the first week of March , and in the second I will be away from the ninth onwards .
so perhaps you could make a suggestion .
hello .
yes , then how about the third week in March ?
perhaps Wednesday the seventeenth .
yes , the seventeenth of March is , of course , not bad .
unfortunately I have got a seminar the whole day until four thirty , and if we could meet afterwards that would not be a problem for me .
but otherwise from the twenty second onwards I would have enough time , yes , to go through the whole matter thoroughly .
on the twenty sixth . if possible , quite early that day .
you said on Friday the twenty sixth ?
yes , that would be no problem .
yes , let us say Friday the twenty sixth .
at nine o &apos;clock ?
or what did you say ?
okay .
if that is possible for you I would even prefer eight o &apos;clock , but if necessary at nine .
eight o &apos;clock is okay for me , too .
so let us say Friday the twenty sixth of March at eight o &apos;clock .
yes , fine ,
Mr Bartlme , then I would say we meet as early as this month ,
that is in August ,
in order to discuss the whole matter again thoroughly .
yes , yes , we should do that still this month , that is in August .
from the third to the sixth I will be at a conference .
afterwards , on the ninth , in the afternoon . would that suit you ?
would that also suit you ?
Wednesday the eleventh of August .
no , I am sorry .
you see , on Wednesday the eleventh of August I must hold a seminar and no , that is not possible .
but I could make another suggestion , namely Tuesday the seventeenth .
yes , I am sorry .
on Tuesday the seventeenth I have got a conference in the afternoon .
that is , if we want to get together the whole day , this date would be very bad .
what do you think of Thursday the nineteenth of August ?
Thursday the nineteenth of August .
yes , that would also suit me .
but , yes , let us better do it in the morning when it is not yes so hot in these summer months .
now I suggest you Thursday the nineteenth of August at nine o &apos;clock .
would that suit you ?
yes , I would totally agree to this date .
so let us meet on Thursday the nineteenth of August .
are you coming to my place or shall I visit you in your office ?
yes , let us say at our place .
on Thursday the nineteenth of August at our place in the company .
okay , thank you .
yes , now we should only find a date in June for our meeting .
just make a suggestion .
well , in the first week in June I have got no time at all ,
I will be on holiday then ,
in the second week it also seems quite tight , the third is bad , too .
how about the fourth , on the twenty fourth ?
that is a Thursday .
would that suit you ?
no ,
I am sorry ,
on the twenty fourth I have already got a meeting in the morning and I would like to keep the afternoon free ,
but I would prefer the twenty third .
on the twenty third of June .
yes , that is comparatively bad , only in the afternoon .
if you would be free in the afternoon we could meet at twelve in our office in the company .
yes ,
as far as I am concerned .
on the twenty third at twelve that is possible for me . yes , very good .
we can also arrange to have lunch .
fine , okay .
I already know a very good restaurant .
fine , agreed , on the twenty third on Wednesday , of June , at twelve .
I would be free on Wednesday the third , could we meet then .
or would not it be possible for you then ?
no , I am sorry .
you know , Wednesday the third is not possible at all , I have got a seminar then , so that is very bad .
how about perhaps the fourth ?
in the afternoon it is still possible .
on the fourth , yes , and , yes , in the afternoon it might be possible .
although ,
I do not know exactly ,
I have got a lecture in the morning and it can always happen that the professor needs a bit longer ,
and if you go the the canteen afterwards , it does not really fit .
yes .
what have you planned on Friday the fifth ?
would you be free then or is not that possible either ?
yes , Friday the fifth .
when ?
well ,
in the morning I have got a meeting with other students because of some task , but basically yes ,
actually yes .
on Friday there is little going on anyway but let us see .
although Friday is actually a little early .
can not we wait a week longer ?
we can try Monday , no , Monday the eighth is not possible at all .
I will not be here from Tuesday to Thursday , Friday is bad , too .
Tuesday the twenty third , how about that ?
yes , on Tuesday the twenty third , as I said , it is usually not possible for me in the morning .
as far as the time is concerned it would suit me best because all I have got to do now I could do till then .
it would suit me best if we , yes , find something that week .
in the week from the twenty second to the twenty sixth of March ?
yes , on the twenty fifth for example , that is a Thursday .
yes , on the twenty fifth , yes , that would be possible .
I do have a lecture in building materials but that does not matter .
well , I can drop that once , and the professor is a little boring anyway .
yes ,
and if there is not enough time we can arrange another date on Friday the twenty sixth in the afternoon .
or on Monday the twenty ninth ,
it is not bad either ,
I have got nothing planned yet ,
if only it is not yet too late .
now I think we should be able to do it before the end of the month ,
and well ,
I will not be there then , I will be at a conference and so that is not possible at all , but on the twenty sixth I have got nothing planned so far .
so that would fit perfectly .
have you got anything planned on the twenty fifth , that is a Thursday ,
so that we can do it only on half a day , or what are your plans ?
I have got a lecture but I can drop it and that is actually no problem , that would be possible .
where shall we meet ?
yes , we could perhaps meet at your place in the practice room if you want to .
so shall we do it on Thursday afternoon , the twenty fifth ?
we can go somewhere else , I do not know ,
the Vogel or something like that is perhaps more comfortable than the practice room and there are not so silly people there .
the only stupid thing is that I am totally booked the week before .
well , from the fifteenth to the nineteenth I can not do anything at all , and before I can not actually do anything either .
that means I will have to do everything this week anyway .
well , but on Friday the fifth I have got nothing planned , I am sure I will manage it then .
until I do not know when .
yes , I actually liked what we did last week ,
and we could actually repeat that ,
and we should also talk about some points .
when would it suit you in April ?
yes , basically it would be possible on Friday the second but that is perhaps a bit early .
we should go through a few things again .
afterwards , however , it gets difficult again .
that is really too early for me .
I would be free but I would like to go home again to my parents .
I would quite like that , I have not seen them for a while .
because the week after I am completely booked .
then I will be on holiday for two days .
yes , the earliest possible date I would say is the sixteenth .
well , on the sixteenth it is not yet possible for me but we could for example arrange something on the nineteenth as long as it is in the morning because at four $ P- $ M I have got my training .
that is bad .
that would suit me perfectly
well , on the nineteenth I have not planned anything , that would suit me perfectly .
well , no problem .
as far as I am concerned yes .
when ? where ?
well , in any case in the morning or before four $ P- $ M .
we can meet at nine .
yes , okay .
where ?
at your place or at any neutral place ?
we can go to a seminar room here in the university . there are enough seminar rooms . one of them is usually free .
yes , okay , I will ask in my faculty , perhaps there is a vacancy .
let us see , one professor will surely have a room .
let us leave it like that and I will call you again tomorrow .
yes ,
that is okay . if not there would be Tuesday the twentieth or Wednesday the twenty first ,
I have got nothing planned then ,
that would not be bad either .
or the week after , Monday , Tuesday , the twenty seventh and twenty eighth , they are completely free , too .
yes , on Monday the twenty sixth I will be free , too .
well , that would be great , no problem .
on the twenty seventh and twenty eighth I have got practical training , I should perhaps be present ,
well , I was not there the last few times and I must revise a little , and on the twenty seventh I have got again
well , on Monday I have always got the problem that I must go at four $ P- $ M .
Tuesday and Wednesday would basically be better but if that does not suit you we will simply leave it on Monday .
yes , okay , then we will leave it like that , I would say , shall not we ?
we will fix the details shortly before .
yes , hello .
we must still fix a date in May .
those in April were quite good but we have still got a lot to do .
how about Thursday the sixth ?
yes , that is nice but you would have to come to Majorca .
so I am on holiday at the moment , till the fifteenth .
I will lie a little in the sun .
well , I would not mind going to Majorca with you , you know .
it is a pity actually that you are away because it is my birthday on Thursday the thirteenth .
I could have invited you otherwise .
is the seventeenth , the Monday , too short notice or could we arrange something then ?
yes ,
Majorca is not so hard ,
so I will probably be relaxed when I come back ,
and I have got a seminar the whole day .
so if we want to we would have to make it in the evening because I hardly ever get up early .
well ,
in the evening , is perhaps bad when you are freshly back from your holiday and then are busy the whole day .
how about Thursday the twentieth ?
I have got nothing planned then .
yes , on Thursday the twentieth I have got a meeting in the morning , but apart from that nothing interesting .
that would actually be possible .
well , the twenty first is a bit bad .
I have got a seminar from eight till five in the evening .
only if it is absolutely necessary , afterwards , or the week after there is still some time left .
yes , so there remains no other solution than the week after .
I only must go to the doctor &apos; s on Monday at four $ P- $ M ,
but that is no problem , a small routine check , and apart from that I have got nothing planned the whole day .
apart from that I am free on Thursday and Friday .
yes , Monday would be really good , I have got nothing to do at all then .
on Thursday I am invited for breakfast at ten .
then we could arrange something afterwards ,
in the afternoon for example ,
and Friday the twenty eighth is very bad again .
yes , okay ,
then there remains no other solution ,
let us take Thursday ,
and when you come back from your brunch you should be awake , should not you ?
I do think I will be awake then .
so let us stay with Thursday the twenty seventh .
how about , say , one ?
we can meet for lunch .
yes , that would suit me .
I could sleep long in the morning .
and yes , okay , I would say so .
yes , where ?
Italian or what ?
yes , we can do that , Italian .
how about the Bella Italia ?
yes , the Bella Italia is quite in the centre , I can actually get there quite easily without having to change transport .
one o &apos;clock , Bella Italia on Thursday the twenty seventh .
yes , great then I would say we fix a date .
when does it suit you ?
perhaps as early as in June ?
yes , June is good .
it would suit me , for example , on Wednesday the ninth .
yes . Wednesday the ninth of June is bad for me because I will be at a training .
how about Tuesday the fifteenth of June in the morning ?
on Tuesday the fifteenth in the morning I have got a meeting from nine till eleven .
it would only suit me around lunchtime .
yes , what do you think about having lunch together ?
at twelve thirty perhaps ?
yes , that would suit me because I must go away as early as two o &apos;clock .
then let us say Wednesday , no , Tuesday the fifteenth of June at twelve thirty .
yes , that is okay for me .
bye .
see you then , bye .
I am glad that I have met you .
now let us fix a date in July .
how would Friday the twenty third suit you ?
on Friday the twenty third I will be in a meeting at two $ P- $ M but if we meet in the morning , no problem .
that would suit me .
then we should arrange a place and a time now .
I would say we meet as early as nine o &apos;clock , here in my office .
could you just tell me your room number ?
yes , I am here in room two hundred and three .
so see you on Friday then .
bye .
see you then .
bye .
hello . I am glad that I have met you .
I would like to meet you for dinner and we could afterwards have a meeting .
that is a good idea .
what do you think of Tuesday the seventeenth of August ?
on the seventeenth of August I have already got a conference which will keep me busy from one to six .
I guess I will be a bit tired at night .
perhaps we should fix another date .
yes , okay , make a suggestion .
the nineteenth , that is a Thursday , would suit me .
I have got basically no appointment fixed for that day .
Thursday the nineteenth of August is also good for me .
then suggest a time .
I would say we meet at seven $ P- $ M .
then it will not get too let afterwards .
yes , that is good .
fine , see you then .
bye .
goodbye .
yes , hello , we should fix a date for the discussion about the lecture on the tenth .
fine , what date would you suggest ?
I would perhaps suggest a date on Friday the fifth .
I am still free the whole day .
on Friday the fifth .
that is bad for me .
would it be possible on Wednesday the third ?
on the third it would be basically possible but perhaps that is still a bit early .
perhaps we can keep Friday after all .
I would be free at two $ P- $ M .
two $ P- $ M would actually be possible but perhaps it would be better in the morning .
perhaps around eleven .
that would suit me better .
at eleven o &apos;clock I will still be in a meeting but that should be over by eleven thirty .
I would suggest eleven thirty .
okay , then I will just eat a bit later .
okay , then we will meet on Friday the fifth of March .
what do you think how long it will take ?
I think it will take at least forty minutes , perhaps even until twelve thirty .
then we will see each other on Friday .
okay ,
Mr Heck , I am ready now ,
now we could fix a date to discuss the whole thing further and make a few tests .
yes , when would you be free , Mr Kupfer ?
yes , basically , today is bad , tomorrow is not so convenient either .
Tuesday or Wednesday it would perhaps fit in somewhere in the afternoon .
Tuesday and Wednesday this week are bad , but perhaps next week on Thursday ?
my calendar is full then . two meetings and besides , university .
so you are only free on Tuesday or Wednesday .
then I would perhaps suggest the fourteenth in the afternoon or on the twentieth I would be free the whole day .
the fourteenth is a Wednesday .
yes , that would be possible .
we could fix it at two $ P- $ M .
yes , then we will fix the date on the fourteenth of April , perhaps from two to six $ P- $ M .
okay , I have taken a note .
so see you on Wednesday the fourteenth at two o &apos;clock .
bye .
goodbye .
fine , Mr Kupfer .
then we would only need an appointment within the next two weeks .
okay , this week is very very bad .
possibly we could arrange something in two weeks .
within the next week would actually suit me better . perhaps in the afternoon ?
oh , I think I will not be ready until next week .
so , before two weeks are over I probably will not get ready anyway .
yes , okay , then let us fix a date between the nineteenth and the twenty third .
except for the nineteenth in the morning I have actually got a lot of free time .
yes , during this week it would be possible for me , too , on the twentieth and on the twenty first .
the twentieth is perhaps not so good , but the twenty first in the afternoon would be very convenient for me .
okay , we could fix the date on the twenty first in the afternoon .
so Wednesday the twenty first in the afternoon . let us say two $ P- $ M ?
okay , two $ P- $ M .
I have taken a note of it .
see you then .
so Wednesday the twenty first , two $ P- $ M .
goodbye , Mr Kupfer .
goodbye .
so now we have discussed everything for today .
and now we should arrange a further meeting .
yes , that probably will not be possible this month .
would August suit you ?
yes , at the beginning of August I have got a conference , that will hardly be possible .
except you would be prepared to fix a date on Saturday .
okay ,
in the first week of August I will be on holiday anyway ,
so only the second or third week of August would be possible ,
and in the second week Monday , Wednesday and Thursday would be very convenient for me .
Monday is very bad , Tuesday the tenth of August would be possible in the morning .
the tenth of August is not so convenient , I have got a conference from one to six $ P- $ M then .
would it be possible for you on the eleventh or twelfth of August ?
no , on the eleventh and twelfth of August we are closed the whole day .
perhaps Friday the thirteenth , if you are not superstituous .
I think Friday the thirteenth is basically a good day , but only in the afternoon if that does not matter to you .
no , not at all .
I always sleep on Friday afternoon anyway .
could we say two $ P- $ M ?
two $ P- $ M is too early ,
I have got a lecture from eleven thirty to one ,
but perhaps at two thirty or three o &apos;clock ?
okay , let us say three o &apos;clock .
I will take a note of it .
okay , so I will make a preliminary note of Friday the thirteenth , three o &apos;clock .
okay , let us hope I will be ready till then .
so see you on Friday the thirteenth .
bye .
goodbye .
hello Oli , we must definitely meet again , it is very urgent .
we have got something important to talk about .
must it be still this month or can we leave it till April or even June ?
that would suit me a lot better .
it would be best on the seventeenth .
I am sorry but on the seventeenth it is not possible at all .
from the eighth to the nineteenth I am busy almost every day .
how about the end of this month ?
the end of this month is good , there is nothing on my agenda yet .
how about as early as Tuesday the twenty third ?
the twenty third would be a possibility .
oh , no , just a moment , we could only meet in the afternoon , that means after twelve or one o &apos;clock .
yes , that is possible but I do not think that will be enough time .
the Wednesday afterwards , how about that ?
I have only got a seminar till nine o &apos;clock .
then we could meet directly afterwards , perhaps at half past nine .
fine , then let us meet then .
how about in your office ?
it is a bit bad in my office , I will be coming from outside .
but I could come to your place .
what do you think of that ?
fine , then let us do it like that .
it will be best if you come to my place on the twenty fourth and we will have enough time to talk the whole thing over .
okay . I will see that I will be punctually at your place at half past nine .
the conference was a total success , we should definitely have a short meeting again this month .
I would say two or three hours should be enough .
what do you think of the twenty fifth ?
you are right .
we should definitely meet again , but on the twenty fifth it is not possible at all .
for one or two hours , I would be free on the tenth , that is a Tuesday .
would that perhaps suit you ?
the tenth could be possible , but only in the morning , since from one o &apos;clock onwards I am booked the whole day .
does it suit you in the morning ?
I am sorry but it is not possible in the morning .
we will have to choose another day then .
perhaps as early as Wednesday the eleventh , I will be free the whole day then .
how does that suit you ?
I am sorry but the eleventh is very bad , I will be busy from morning till six o &apos;clock in the evening .
except you would not mind meeting in the evening .
I think that should not be a problem on Wednesday .
where shall we meet ?
unfortunately it is no longer possible in the office .
yes , I think we could meet in a conference hall .
I would have to ask my boss if he gets me the key .
what do you think of seven $ P- $ M ?
okay , then I will come to your place on the nineteenth and we will have enough time to discuss the thing .
okay , but may I remind you that it was not the nineteenth but the eleventh , at seven $ P- $ M ?
excuse me , of course you are always right .
so then we will have the conference on the eleventh .
great that I have met you .
let us make an appointment .
how about Thursday the tenth of June .
no , it is not possible for me on Thursday the tenth of June .
I have got a sales meeting the whole day .
that is a pity because on Thursday I would be free from nine to eleven .
perhaps it is possible on Wednesday the sixteenth of June ?
no , on Wednesday the sixteenth of June I am already booked , too .
but are you perhaps free on the eighth of June ?
on the eighth of June I am at a training that takes place both on Monday the seventh of June and Wednesday the ninth of June .
would Monday in general suit you ?
hello , I wanted to fix a date with you for our job interview .
would you perhaps be free on a Friday ?
Friday in general is not convenient for me because I have already arranged meetings and appointments .
but how about Tuesday the sixth of July ?
on Tuesday the sixth of July I am only free very early in the morning or in the late afternoon because I have got a seminar from nine to four .
would it be possible for you in the morning at seven or in the afternoon at five ?
no , my working day does not start before nine .
how about Monday the nineteenth at five ?
that is no problem if you can come to Gran Canaria since on Monday the nineteenth I will still be on holiday .
I will be back on Tuesday the twentieth of July .
however , on Tuesday I have always got my seminar from nine to four , and since this does not comply with your working hours , would perhaps another day suit you ?
let me have a look .
Friday I have told you is always booked , on Thursday I have got meetings from nine to twelve ,
we could only fix a date in the afternoon .
Thursday at four $ P- $ M on the fourteenth of July .
how about that ?
therefore I would suggest Thursday the eighth of July , in the afternoon .
no , exactly on Thursday the eighth of July I have got an appointment at the language foundation .
how about Monday the fifth of July ?
Monday the fifth of July is a day on which I am completely free .
how about in the afternoon at three thirty ?
yes , three thirty would suit me perfectly .
perhaps you also make an appointment with my secretary so that she takes a note of it .
bye .
hello , Mr Strack .
we said on Friday that we would contact each other again in order to fix a date to talk about the other business details .
yes ,
then I would say we will meet again as soon as possible , and I would suggest , if possible ,
as early as this month .
this month ? that is a bit bad . my calendar is really packed this month .
it would suit me best in July .
in the first days of July .
for example right on Friday the second of July .
on Friday the second of July .
that is bad .
I will be away then .
then on Monday the fifth .
now a basic question . where shall we have the meeting ? at you place or at mine ?
as it is better for you .
I go along with your wishes .
fine ,
then I would say we will meet at your place ,
but on Monday ,
I really do not know . I think that does not really suit me .
as it is better for you ,
and we will see if I will be free then ,
perhaps my calendar is not quite as packed .
how about Thursday the eighth of July ?
the eighth of July yes , in the afternoon it would be possible .
in the morning I have got a meeting , but perhaps around two $ P- $ M I am sure I would be free .
so you will be free at two $ P- $ M .
well , I will be free till four $ P- $ M .
so we would have two hours .
oh , that should be enough . yes , two hours , that is all right .
okay , then I would say let us fix that .
on Thursday the eighth of July at two $ P- $ M at my place .
fine , okay .
I will come to your place and bring the relevant documents .
bye .
hello , Mr Gau &quot; s .
we roughly said we would meet in August and I suggested in the second week of August .
hello , Mr Strack .
in the second week of August .
that seems very bad for me .
the only date possible would be Friday the thirteenth .
Friday the thirteenth . yes , that will be a bit tight for me .
I have got a lecture in the afternoon , and we said we will need a little more than a morning for our project .
yes , how about the week after
and how about the week after ?
on the sixteenth , on Monday , for example .
on Monday it is not possible , I have got a lecture then .
on Monday morning it would be possible and on Thursday afternoon , or the whole day on Friday .
yes , then Thursday afternoon would be best because Friday I have got another lecture and then we have got the same problem as in the week before .
then I would suggest on Thursday the nineteenth of August , in the afternoon .
yes , fine , we will take a note of this date .
but what will we do if we do not get finished on Thursday afternoon ?
I would say we will fix our next date on Thursday and also bring our calendars then .
now the only question is when we will meet on Thursday , at what time .
I would suggest around two $ P- $ M ?
yes , two $ P- $ M would suit me .
okay , the let us fix that , on the nineteenth of August at two $ P- $ M .
so see you then , Mr Gau &quot; s .
fine , bye now .
should anything change I will call you again .
fine , okay , so see you then . bye .
yes , great , then let us fix a date .
would you still be free in August ?
yes , okay , August , I do not know . but okay , that would be possible .
we must only agree on a day .
how do you like Monday ?
how about Monday the sixteenth of August ?
would be be free then ?
on Monday the sixteenth of August at this time it would be bad .
I would therefore suggest Wednesday , at what time ?
oh , Wednesday is not possible either . yes , Wednesday the eleventh at nine $ A- $ M .
yes , on the eleventh of August I will be free , too .
however , I would prefer to meet early in the morning .
what do you think of half past eight ?
yes , half past eight would be quite a good time .
this will leave us enough time to have lunch afterwards and ,
yes , I would accept that date .
so let us say Wednesday the eleventh of August , half past eight .
see you then , bye .
yes , okay , we should then agree on a date in April .
I would suggest April the first , not so early , say after lunch .
what do you think of that ?
I hope that is no April fool &apos; s trick , but let us leave all jokes behind .
unfortunately I have got a dentist &apos; s appointment from eight till eleven , and the afternoon is also quite packed ,
so I would prefer to go to the second week in April .
what do you think of Tuesday the sixth of April ?
I will be away then , so I have got no time for you either .
but it would suit me two days later ,
on the eighth of April , yes , let us say at nine o &apos;clock in the morning .
would that suit you ?
I am sorry , I must disappoint you .
I must give a presentation in a seminar which goes till five $ P- $ M .
what do you think about Friday , sixteenth of April ?
so the sixteenth of April , that does not really suit me because I must go home early then .
and how about the Monday afterwards , on the nineteenth of April ?
yes , that sounds great .
Monday , nineteenth of April .
please suggest a time .
as far as I am concerned , I would say we will make it a little earlier because I want to do sports in the late afternoon ,
and let us say nine o &apos;clock ,
shortly before lunch ,
and then we will see .
would that suit you ?
fine , then let us leave it like that .
that was a bit difficult now , but now we will stay with this date .
okay , thanks a lot .
it is great that I have met you .
we should arrange another appointment in November .
yes , good that you remind me .
I would say would the second of November suit you , Wednesday ?
will you be free then ?
I am sorry but I will still be on holiday then .
I will not be back before Monday , that is November the seventh .
that is getting a bit difficult ,
I have got no time at all then ,
I will be at a training session half of the week .
and the Thursday afterwards I have got no time either , I have got a meeting then .
how about the fourteenth ?
that is a Monday .
on Monday the fourteenth of November I am only free in the afternoon .
if you would be free then we could arrange a date .
bad .
that is also a bit bad .
to be honest I would prefer two days later , on the sixteenth , that would be a Wednesday .
well , then we should meet in the morning though .
what do you think of a business breakfast ? at half past eight perhaps ?
so a business breakfast , that would not be bad .
I would agree to that .
does the time suit you or shall we meet earlier or perhaps later ?
what would you like ?
well , I would say that since it is a business breakfast we should perhaps meet earlier .
okay , if it suits you we would meet on November the sixteenth .
okay ?
okay , at eight o &apos;clock then .
see you then , bye .
I would like to arrange a date with you .
when are you free ?
well , Tuesday the sixth of April would be convenient for me .
I am sorry but on Tuesday the sixth I will be away .
how about the twentieth ?
okay , then I suggest the twentieth at two $ P- $ M .
personally , I would prefer an appointment in the morning .
okay , then I suggest eight o &apos;clock .
very good , that suits me .
then we meet on Tuesday the twentieth of April at eight o &apos;clock .
okay , see you then .
bye .
so , now we should arrange a date to meet again .
yes , great .
I will be on holiday from the fourteenth to the nineteenth .
what do you suggest ?
I would say perhaps the twenty first ?
the twenty first of June would suit me .
I would be off the whole day then .
okay , then I would suggest perhaps directly after the lunch break , around two $ P- $ M ?
agreed , we can meet then .
so see you then , same time , same place .
okay .
so , now we still need a date for our next meeting .
yes . at the beginning of the month I have got no time .
I am booked till the twelfth .
on the thirteenth it is possible again .
I am sorry but I am booked on the thirteenth , but on the sixteenth and the nineteenth I am free the whole day .
I am sorry but on the sixteenth I have got no time , only after one $ P- $ M .
on the nineteenth I would be free the whole day .
choose any time you like .
then I would suggest we meet on the nineteenth , perhaps around nine o &apos;clock in the morning at the same place .
fine , then we will meet on the nineteenth .
what was the place there we met last time ?
in the new information science building , second floor , room two hundred and three .
okay , then we will meet there .
see you then .
bye .
for our next meeting I suggest the second week in August , I have got lots of time then .
that is a bit tight for me though , but I could squeeze you in on Friday the thirteenth .
on Friday the thirteenth I would be free until eleven thirty and again after one .
make you choice .
I would suggest we take Friday the thirteenth of August , around eight in the morning , in the new information science building ,
on the second floor ,
room two hundred and three .
how about meeting on the third floor .
I have got a lecture there .
fine , that is okay for me , too .
let us do it like that . bye .
yes , I can see in my calendar that I would be free on the third of March .
would you be free then ?
the third of March does not really suit me .
I would rather suggest the twenty third of March .
the twenty third , but I have got a lecture then between nine and twelve .
so , it would only be possible in the afternoon .
yes , I would be free in the afternoon .
what would you suggest ?
I have just seen that I have got my training then .
so after all , it is not possible for me on the twenty third .
but how about the twenty fourth ?
I will be away then , that is impossible .
how about the twenty fifth ?
twenty fifth , twenty fifth , is not that a bank holiday ?
I am actually going home then .
then you probably will not be here on the twenty sixth of March either .
how about the twenty ninth ?
well , if we do not make it too early , I would say some time in the afternoon , perhaps at three o &apos;clock ?
three o &apos;clock would be okay , although I will be free only till seven .
do you think that will be enough ?
we can also meet again on Tuesday or Wednesday .
I can see from my agenda that it is crowded .
perhaps you can make a suggestion ?
I would suggest the sixteenth of April .
it that possible ?
the sixteenth of April .
oh , I will not be home before the afternoon .
I do not know if we have got enough time then .
I will come home at four and then after a conference .
I do not think I will be fit enough then to do anything .
how about the nineteenth of April ?
nineteenth of April .
if it is not between two and five $ P- $ M when I have got my training ,
then we could arrange an appointment in the morning .
perhaps we can fix two appointments and then take the morning hours of the nineteenth of April .
perhaps we find another day on which a few hours are possible .
perhaps on the twenty seventh and twenty eighth in the week after .
that would be convenient insofar as I am free on the twenty seventh in the afternoon .
the twenty eighth is bad .
we can keep to the suggestion , on the nineteenth of April in the morning and on the twenty seventh in the afternoon .
let us perhaps meet on the nineteenth of April at nine .
how long did you say you would be free ?
afterwards I must go to my training .
okay , then on that Monday between nine and one .
and what do you suggest for the twenty seventh ?
the afternoon would suit me . let us say at half past three ?
how long do you think the meeting would last ?
that depends of course on how far we get on the nineteenth , but I think on the nineteenth we will not need more than two to two and a half hours .
fine , and where shall we meet ?
well , I would say either in your institute or in mine .
I do not know , where will you be on the twenty seventh ?
let us simply do it like that ,
on the nineteenth we will meet in your institute and on the twenty seventh in my institute .
we still have to make an appointment .
I suggest Wednesday the sixteenth of June .
then how about the eighteenth of June ?
the eighteenth of June ?
that is not possible at all , I will be on holiday then .
the seventeenth , eighteenth and nineteenth are not possible .
could not we do it earlier ?
for example on the ninth of June .
on the ninth of June I have got a training .
how about the eleventh of June ?
there is no entry on the eleventh of June , so we should find a date then .
how about in the afternoon at five thirty ?
five thirty is perhaps a bit late because I have already got another appointment at eight .
could we do it earlier ?
would it suit you if we met at , say , half past two ?
half past two should be okay .
then it is best if we fix that date .
oh , hello colleague .
I am glad that I have met you .
we were to make an appointment for our next meeting .
would you perhaps be free on the ninth of August ?
it would only be possible for me in the afternoon .
but perhaps the thirteenth of August would be better .
let us see .
yes , oh , I have got a lecture then , from eleven thirty to one .
if at all , we could do it in the afternoon .
would that suit you ?
yes , that would be possible , although I would prefer it in the morning .
perhaps we should see if we can find another day .
how about the seventeenth of August ?
I have got a conference that day and must prepare myself in the morning .
would it perhaps be possible one day earlier , on the sixteenth ?
well , on the sixteenth I have also got a lecture in the morning .
how about Friday the twentieth of August ?
I have got lectures from eleven thirty to one .
and what about the nineteenth ?
the nineteenth of August would be okay .
I would suggest we meet between nine and one .
is that okay ?
let us meet in the cafeteria then .
we wanted to get together next week for a further meeting .
how about for example Wednesday the third of March ?
that week seems rather bad for me .
I would rather suggest we will meet on Tuesday the ninth of March .
I will be at home practically the whole week .
I have noticed that next week is generally bad , too .
how about , for example , Tuesday the twenty third ?
in the afternoon . is that okay ?
I agree to that .
let us say at three $ P- $ M ?
I have just noticed that it is not possible for me on the twenty third of March .
would it perhaps be possible two days later , on the twenty fifth ?
agreed .
let us say on the twenty fifth at three $ P- $ M .
yes , I think that is okay .
hello , Mr Eich .
we still have to arrange a meeting in June , during the first two weeks .
when would it suit you ?
make a suggestion .
hello , Mr Schaf .
yes , during the first two weeks I seem to be rather booked .
I would be free on Friday the fourth of June and on Friday the eleventh of June .
apart from that , it is not really possible .
you see I will be away then .
Friday the eleventh would be inconvenient .
perhaps we could find a better date .
would it perhaps be possible the week after ?
and Wednesday the sixteenth , also of course again on Friday the eighteenth .
yes , I would actually like Wednesday the sixteenth , but I have a meeting in the afternoon .
would it be possible in the morning ?
I have got nothing planned then .
we could arrange an appointment then .
shall we do it like that ?
when do you want me to come round ?
it would be best around eight thirty .
would that be possible ?
hello , Mr Schaf .
I must definitely arrange a meeting with you , on the topic we talked about yesterday .
would it be possible in third week of July ?
in the third week of July it would only be possible on Monday or Tuesday .
Tuesday would not be bad at all .
when would you be free then ?
on Tuesday it would only be possible after four $ P- $ M since I have a seminar before .
that is a bit late for me though .
would not it perhaps be possible at another date during that week ?
well , perhaps I could squeeze you in on Thursday .
how long do you think we will need ?
well , I think we should have at least one hour .
yes , Thursday the fifteenth from nine thirty to ten thirty .
would that suit you ?
nine thirty to ten thirty is very bad because I have already got a meeting from nine to twelve .
how about in the afternoon ?
we could only arrange something after four $ P- $ M .
yes , on that day I would be free after four $ P- $ M .
shall we fix our meeting then ?
reluctantly , but I think we will have to do it like that .
okay , then let us fix that .
thank you and goodbye .
hello , Mr Schaf .
we must urgently make an appointment because of the last conference .
a few things were left open then .
yes , I am glad you have mentioned it .
have you already thought about a date ?
yes , I have .
and how about , for example , the first week of August ?
is there any day that would suit you ?
I would be free then .
oh , the first week of August is really bad because there is that conference .
could not we postpone it to the second week of August ?
on Monday I have got lectures from eight to one , but afterwards , for example .
well , Monday afternoon is very bad .
on Wednesday or Thursday I would have time for you the whole day .
how about then ?
Wednesday is impossible .
on Thursday we might arrange something between eleven and three .
yes , between eleven and three it would be possible .
only the topic should take some time .
well , we will need at least two hours for it .
well , I have got two meetings that day , one before our meeting and one afterwards .
so we should probably start immediately at twelve .
well , that is actually no problem , we could agree on that .
shall we do it like that ?
would you be free on Friday ?
Friday .
fine ,
Friday morning would be possible ,
I have got a lecture on Friday afternoon . then it would not be possible at all .
fine , I would prefer that a lot .
then I will suggest a date in the morning .
let us say around nine .
okay , we can fix that .
Friday at nine o &apos;clock .
let us do it like that .
do you want me to come to your place ?
yes , that would be most convenient for me .
then we will do it like that . bye .
we still have to make an appointment .
I would suggest Wednesday the seventeenth of March .
just a moment , I have to look at my calendar .
Wednesday , Wednesday , Wednesday , seventeenth of March .
that is bad for me , I am already booked .
we have to take another date then .
how about the twenty third of March ?
I have got a lecture in the morning and a meeting in the afternoon .
how about the twenty fifth of March ?
that would be possible if necessary .
however , I wanted to go away for the weekend .
could not we perhaps postpone it to the twenty ninth ?
that would suit me better .
from the twenty ninth of March to the thirty first of March I will be away .
so that would be very inconvenient .
how about the twenty second of March ?
if necessary .
however , I have already got a meeting in the morning .
we could have a closer look at the twenty second of March .
perhaps we still find another half of a day that is free for our meeting .
how about the twenty fifth or March ?
the twenty fifth of March would be possible if necessary .
but as I already said I wanted to go away then and would therefore have to go home earlier .
but of course we can try it .
then I would suggest we will meet on the twenty second of March .
what time did you say you should be free ?
my meeting is planned to last till eleven o &apos;clock .
so I would say I would be free at eleven thirty .
yes ,
then let us meet at eleven thirty and see how far we get ,
and if necessary we can perhaps meet again on the twenty fifth in the morning .
that sounds really good .
I would say let us simply try it .
we were to fix a date in order to discuss the questions not yet solved .
I agree with you .
how about Friday the thirteenth of August ?
the thirteenth of August is not so good , I have a lecture in the morning and would not be free before the afternoon .
we should better take Thursday , the twelfth of August .
I am sorry but Thursday is impossible for me , I already have meetings the whole day .
how about Tuesday the seventeenth of August ?
completely full , that is not at all possible .
but the nineteenth of August would be very good for me .
on the eighteenth and nineteenth of August , I have got two seminars the whole day , so that is not possible for me .
perhaps we could take the twenty fourth of August .
not that month because I always have a conference that lasts almost the whole day .
how about Monday the twenty third of August ?
on Monday the twenty third of August I have got a lecture in the morning ,
so I would not be free before the afternoon .
would it perhaps be possible on the twenty fifth ?
I have got nothing planned then .
yes , I agree to that .
we still have to fix a date in June .
however , I must tell you that in the week of the fourteenth ,
that is a Wednesday ,
up to the nineteenth of July , I will be on holiday .
when would it suit you ?
basically , I have got no time in the morning ,
and besides , I will not be here during the week from the nineteenth to the twenty first of June .
but how about , for example , the fifth of July ?
I would still be free the whole day .
the fifth of July is not so good .
how about Wednesday the seventh of July ?
the seventh of July would also suit me , I am still free the whole day .
could we meet then ?
yes , that would be great .
suggest a time .
well , I would suggest at nine $ A- $ M ,
then we would have time the whole day for our meeting and could have lunch at a nice restaurant .
hello , Mr Ludwig . let us fix a date .
fine , Mr Meldau .
when would it suit you ?
on the seventh of July , that is a Wednesday , it would suit me between half past five and six .
I am sorry , but on the seventh of July I have got no time at all since I have at
I am sorry but on the seventh of July I have got a seminar at two $ P- $ M .
would the fourteenth suit you ?
I am terribly sorry but on the fourteenth of July I am going on holiday .
how about the ninth , that is a Friday ?
on Friday the ninth of July I will be on a business trip to Munich , that is not possible .
but I could suggest you the twenty first .
I am sorry but I will be away then .
but how about the twenty third ?
the twenty third of July would suit me .
let us say nine o &apos;clock ?
I would prefer twelve o &apos;clock .
well , Mr Meldau , how about fixing a date in February ?
with pleasure . how about the sixth of February ?
the sixth of February does not suit me at all ,
I will be away then , but I would be free on the twentieth or twenty first of February .
I am sorry but on the twentieth of February I will be on holiday ,
and on the twenty first I have got an urgent appointment with my doctor .
how about the fourteenth of February ?
time , but I could offer you the twenty seventh or twenty eighth .
on the twenty eighth I have got an important meeting ,
so I am sorry but that is not possible , but on the twenty seventh I am basically free .
fine , let us say ten o &apos;clock .
does that suit you ?
ten o &apos;clock would not suit me , the afternoon is better .
let us say two thirty ?
okay , two thirty then on the twenty seventh .
goodbye , Mr Meldau .
well , Mr Ludwig , then let us fix a date for our next meeting .
I suggest the nineteenth of January .
I would be free then .
I am sorry , Mr Meldau .
on the nineteenth I am booked the whole day .
but on the seventeenth of January . would that suit you ?
I am sorry but on the seventeenth of January I have got an important conference , but on the twenty fifth I would be free again .
I have got a lecture then .
how about in the afternoon ?
in the afternoon unfortunately not before four $ P- $ M .
at four $ P- $ M , that would be a bit tight .
then I would suggest the thirty first of January .
I would be free the whole day .
then on the thirty first of January in the morning .
in the afternoon I have got a conference .
so I suggest nine thirty .
okay , Mr Meldau .
so at nine thirty on the thirty first of January .
we were to meet again for the preparation of the teaching test , and I wanted to ask you when it would suit you next week .
yes , Georg ,
I do not know exactly ,
because today is Friday the third and ,
okay ,
the next few days are not so good .
you must know ,
on the ninth of March I have got an exam at two $ P- $ M and now I would have to prepare myself for it .
well , I would suggest a date after the ninth of March .
after the ninth .
yes , fine , that is possible .
on the thirteenth , for example , I only have a group meeting from nine to eleven ,
and I would be free the rest of the day .
the thirteenth you say . I will be free in the morning .
at two $ P- $ M I have got intensive practical training , that will go from two to six $ P- $ M .
so that is not possible , and the intensive practical training will last till Thursday .
so on the thirteenth , fourteenth , fifteenth and sixteenth I have got my practical training .
I would be free in the morning then .
on the fourteenth , fifteenth and sixteenth I will also be free in the morning , and so I would actually prefer the fourteenth .
if you ask me , from ten to one .
is that okay ?
yes , that would be okay .
on the fourteenth of March in the morning we can meet .
hello ,
we should talk about the exam in May , and we should fix a meeting at the beginning of April , as early as possible .
yes , we could do that .
when would you be free ?
well , today is the seventh .
on Monday the tenth it is not possible at all .
Tuesday morning would be good .
Tuesday morning .
that would be the eleventh of April .
that would suit me , too .
okay , that is great for me .
from nine to twelve ?
yes , we could meet from nine to twelve .
okay , then we will do it like that .
when could we meet ?
well , today is the fourth
tomorrow , on Friday would actually be best for me .
then we would have it over as fast as possible , and I would be free the whole day .
unfortunately that is not possible for me ,
on Friday the fifth I must prepare posters and pack , and so I will be busy the whole day .
I would suggest now that we perhaps meet on the fifteenth of May .
yes ,
that is also the earliest date possible for me ,
because next week , from the eighth to the twelfth , I will be away the whole week ,
and the fifteenth of May would be the first date possible for me and then I will be free the whole day ,
so that actually suits me quite well .
do you prefer the morning or the afternoon ?
well , I have got nothing planned for the fifteenth , too ,
there is nothing on my agenda ,
so we could meet , say , in the afternoon ,
after lunch .
yes , that suits me .
I would suggest two $ P- $ M .
yes , two $ P- $ M on the fifteenth of May .
hello Andjelko .
the conference is over now .
and now the next conference is coming , and for this conference , too , we should have a short discussion about which topics we will suggest .
the conference takes place in August , but in the middle of July I have not got much time .
yes , we must do that .
and today is already the twenty seventh of June .
my calendar is also full in June .
and I would like to suggest that we will meet this month , namely on the thirtieth of June .
would you be free on that day ?
that would be Friday the thirtieth of June .
the thirtieth of June is really bad for me , I will be busy the whole day .
but the Monday after , the third of July would be very convenient for me .
an alternative would be Wednesday the fifth .
I am sorry but Monday the third of July is not possible for me because I will be on holiday then ,
and you have suggested the fifth .
that seems really bad for me because I have an appointment at the dentist &apos; s in the morning , and besides , I will be busy the whole day anyway .
well , that does not seem to be good . as an alternative I would suggest the tenth of July ,
that is a Monday .
does that suit you ?
let me ask you , would it suit you on the sixth or seventh of July ,
on the sixth in the afternoon or on the seventh ?
well , I would be free on the sixth of July in the morning ,
because later ,
from three thirty till four thirty $ P- $ M , I have got a meeting for PhD students .
of course we could meet after half past four on the sixth of July .
the seventh is bad again because in the morning I have got a seminar from nine to twelve , and in the afternoon , I am meeting Thomas and so I have got no time then .
well , that means it is not possible that week .
in the week from the tenth to the fourteenth I am actually booked .
on the seventeenth and eighteenth I would be free in the morning .
you have just suggested the seventeenth of July , that would perhaps be possible in the morning if we could meet as early as eight o &apos;clock ,
from eight to ten ,
because later , from ten to twelve , I have got a presentation .
I will be at a presentation by Doctor Bobitsch .
would that suit you ?
I do not know .
I think two hours are too short a period .
fine ,
how about the nineteenth of July ?
in the morning ,
that is a Wednesday ,
I will be free in the morning .
no , that is not possible at all .
I would suggest , either the twentieth , I will be free the whole day , or the eighteenth in the morning .
the twentieth is very good .
that is a Thursday as I can see from my calendar .
I would be free in the morning .
in the afternoon I will also have to prepare a meeting with Dave .
so we could meet on the twentieth of July .
in the morning , that would be a Thursday .
would that suit you ?
that is very convenient to me .
you can fix the time .
fine , then we will meet at , say , nine o &apos;clock on Thursday the twentieth of July .
okay , that is very convenient to me .
hello Andjelko .
you know today is Tuesday , the first of August and we were to meet within the next two weeks in order to talk about the last conference .
what do you think about it ?
I am very busy in the next two weeks but I am sure we could find a date .
now I could suggest you that we will meet perhaps as early as today .
right now , I have got a lecture from ten to twelve , afterwards , in the afternoon I would be free .
well , that seems really bad for me , I am actually very busy this afternoon .
let me just tell you on which mornings within the next two weeks I am free , and then we can systematically try and find a date .
I would be free in the morning on Monday the seventh ,
on Tuesday the eighth ,
on Thursday the tenth and Friday the eleventh , and also on Monday the fourteenth and Tuesday the fifteenth .
are you free on any of these days ?
I did not quite understand if you meant only in the morning , but if we take Wednesday the ninth ,
I would be free in the morning .
in the afternoon , I have got a lecture from three thirty to four thirty .
would you be free on Wednesday the ninth ?
no , I will be preparing a conference for the whole day , together with Toni . you know him , too .
how about Monday the fourteenth of July , early in the morning ?
that would be very good , I would be free then .
in the morning I have got nothing planned , there is nothing on my calendar yet .
I only have to prepare a presentation from three to five $ P- $ M .
so we could meet on Monday the fourteenth .
great , that is very convenient for me .
I would suggest we will meet from nine to twelve and afterwards have lunch together .
exactly , that is a good idea , that is how we will do it .
okay . see you on the fourteenth .
hello Mariusch .
we were to make a date for our meeting .
when would it perhaps suit you ?
hello Felix .
well , when would it suit me ?
tell me first what our meeting is about .
we wanted to prepare for the exam in software technology ,
to go through one or two exercise sheets and compile a selection of topics .
oh yes , now I remember .
yes , fine , how much time would we need for it ?
yes , three hours is okay .
fine , tell me , when would it suit you ?
well , I would be free the whole day on Friday .
which Friday do you mean exactly ?
Friday , sixth of January , this week .
no , that is not really possible , or only after four $ P- $ M .
that would be too late then .
so let us try the week after .
how about Monday afternoon , let us say at two o &apos;clock ?
the Monday afterwards , it is only possible for me after three $ P- $ M .
no , just a moment , wait a second . let us say at four $ P- $ M .
but we do need three hours .
that means we would be finished after six $ P- $ M .
that would be too late for me , I would be home late .
and how about Tuesday , again at two $ P- $ M ?
does that suit you ?
no ,
on that Tuesday I have got no time at all , I have got to prepare myself for my seminar and so I have got no time the whole day .
it is not possible for me before Thursday perhaps , at around three $ P- $ M .
no , I am sorry , I have my practical training from two to five $ P- $ M .
how about Friday ?
well , on that Friday I am booked again ,
that is Friday the thirteenth ,
and besides I am superstitious and it does not suit me at all .
I would rather suggest Tuesday after , that is Tuesday the seventeenth .
oh yes , Tuesday the seventeenth would be good , I would be free at two $ P- $ M .
so I would say , let us meet at two $ P- $ M .
do you know where I live ?
no , I only know you live in Ettlingen .
I have not got the exact address .
fine , the address is Ettlingen , thirteen Donigweg .
so thirteen Donigweg , $ D $ O $ N $ I $ G .
correct ?
okay then , see you that Tuesday .
bye .
hello Felix .
how are you ?
I am fine .
I went skiing for two weeks in the Christmas holidays and now I am really relaxed . and you ?
yes , Christmas holidays , they are already some time ago , are not they ?
but as far as I remember I passed them well .
you know I wanted to meet you .
and why exactly ?
it is about the practical training in algorithm technique .
we have to talk about the exercise sheet number three .
yes , so that could take a bit longer .
I would say we will need two to three hours .
what do you think ?
yes , or even longer .
I think we might need up to three and a half hours maximum for it .
okay , so suggest a date , please .
how about next weekend ?
oh , weekends are really bad for me , I am usually at home then .
I always go home on weekends , as you know .
yes , I have forgotten that .
okay , then perhaps how about tomorrow ?
yes , that would suit me , I have nothing planned for then .
at what time ?
oh no , stop , I have got no time then .
I am sorry , I have to pick up someone from the airport .
I am sorry .
the next date that would suit me is Wednesday the fifteenth .
yes , fine , but only in the afternoon .
let us say , after lunch at one $ P- $ M .
does that suit you ?
after lunch ?
how about the evening , if we perhaps make a business dinner out of it ?
business dinner is good .
well yes .
however , I am already booked that evening .
I will be playing tennis in the gym with some friends .
how about Friday the seventeenth ?
on that day , my calendar is still empty .
Friday the seventeenth is not possible at all because I need the whole day to prepare myself for my seminar .
so , now we finally have to find a date .
the last possibility I can offer is Thursday the sixteenth in the afternoon at three .
I hope that suits you .
I will still have to prepare myself for the seminar but I think I could spare a few hours at three $ P- $ M .
fine , I know where you are living .
I will simply come to your place then .
okay ?
fine , I will be waiting for you .
bye .
hello , Mariusch .
I am glad that I have just met you .
we are to talk about the exercise sheet on informal systems .
have you already started with it ?
you mean the new one .
no , I have not yet started with it .
we should get together and go through it .
yes , exactly .
would next week suit you ?
is there any day on which you are free ?
in the afternoon perhaps ?
in the afternoon , it is difficult , only Friday the tenth .
yes , that would suit me , there is nothing on my agenda then .
what time would suit you ?
I am free the whole day .
so I can go along with your wishes .
well , in that case I could go shopping in the morning and we could meet in the afternoon .
half past one , shortly after lunch , is actually quite convenient for me .
what do you think , how long will we need for it ?
well , I think we should not need more than three or four hours for it .
fine , then I can do something else afterwards .
okay .
so see you on Friday the tenth .
shall we meet at my place or at yours ?
I would say we will meet at your place .
then you will not forget again to bring the documents .
ha , ha , ha .
okay , see you next week then .
bye .
hello , Felix .
oh , I am glad I have met you .
you know ,
I have got a problem with the last exercise sheet on algorithm technique , and I have got a few questions on the binary trees .
could I get together with you ?
yes , why not ?
I have already done the exercise sheet .
we can go through it together .
so , as I told you , some things are not quite clear to me , and I would like to get together with you next week .
what do you think ?
yes , I have got a lot of time next week , except for Monday .
I have got a lecture and a meeting then .
but on Tuesday , Wednesday and Friday I am free .
for me , Wednesday and Thursday would be quite convenient .
however , I would prefer us to meet perhaps on Wednesday , the third of May .
would that suit you ?
yes , however , I have got a lecture in the morning at ten , so we would have to meet in the afternoon .
I would suggest that we meet at three $ P- $ M .
does that suit you ?
at three $ P- $ M I actually wanted
oh , yes , on that day I am off and three $ P- $ M is quite good .
no , the library is actually fine for me since I will be in the cafeteria before our meeting .
where exactly shall we meet ?
on the second floor ?
yes , the second floor is okay , although we must not talk to loudly there , but it is okay .
shall we meet upstairs or downstairs ?
I would say let us meet upstairs , and I am usually sitting relatively near to the photocopier .
so , see you then .
yes , fine , see you then .
bye .
hello , Mariusch
there is something I would like to tell you , I must prepare a seminar and would like to ask you something .
you have already participated in this seminar , have not you ?
it is called objects in isolated systems .
yes , I did , last year .
what questions do you have exactly ? on which topic ?
it is about the operation system Next-Step , about the extension isolated portable objects ,
and I wanted to ask you how you structured your presentation .
could you show me that some time ?
however , we will need at least two hours for that .
should we get together on that matter some time ?
yes , I would say so .
let me suggest you a date , Friday the sixteenth would be convenient for me .
wait a second .
today is Wednesday , the fourteenth , and you mean Friday .
no , I am sorry , but that is not possible , I am booked for the whole day .
perhaps , how about tomorrow ?
tomorrow I am actually off the whole day .
well , that seems rather bad for me .
in the morning , I have got a meeting with Uli from nine to eleven , and in the afternoon I have got practical training from two to five .
no , that makes no sense .
so we will better try next week .
how about Tuesday the twentieth , in the morning ?
can you suggest another date ?
well , on that Tuesday I might also have time in the afternoon .
you only must tell me when you will be free .
yes , okay .
as I told you I do not know exactly how long that will last .
but I think I will be free at three $ P- $ M .
so I could meet you at three $ P- $ M .
okay , I will probably be free at four $ P- $ M .
so I would say let us meet then .
now there is only the question where we will meet .
would you like to come to my place ?
to your place in Ettlingen . that is a bit far away , but okay , I can accept that suggestion .
did you say four $ P- $ M ?
yes , four $ P- $ M is okay .
and remember to bring the documents .
I definitely will .
okay , I will take a note of it in my agenda .
see you then .
bye .
yes , bye , see you then .
hello , Tobi .
I am fine , there is only something in $ D $ I that I do not understand at the moment .
yes , I have got the same problems .
let us meet some time and do the exercise sheet together .
that would be a good idea , yes .
how about next Monday ?
will you be free then ?
just a moment , I first have to have a look at my agenda .
that is Monday the nineteenth , is not it ?
yes , that is right .
well , I already have an appointment at eight thirty in the morning , and actually in the afternoon , too .
that is actually bad .
sorry , Tuesday morning .
on Tuesday morning , I have already an appointment at ten .
it would only be possible on Tuesday afternoon .
I am sorry , but in the afternoon I will be in the library .
can not you postpone that ?
yes , actually it does not matter if I go to the library in the morning or in the afternoon .
shall we meet Tuesday afternoon , Tuesday , the second of June ?
fine , at three o &apos;clock ?
okay , three o &apos;clock .
then we can have dinner afterwards .
at my place or at your place ?
have you got anything to eat at home ?
I think so , yes .
okay , then on Tuesday at your place .
fine , see you on Tuesday then .
hello , Robert .
nice to meet you again .
how are you ?
hello , Tobias , you know how I usually am .
shall we meet some time ?
okay , we might go swimming again .
how about tomorrow ?
tomorrow is Friday , is not it ?
right , yes .
oh , tomorrow already seems to be quite packed .
perhaps at night ?
actually , I did not want to be still here on Friday night .
and will you be back again on Monday ?
no , I will be in America till Wednesday .
oh , Thursday is really , really bad , I have to lead a workshop the whole day long .
you do seem to be very busy .
and perhaps on Friday , if possible , in the afternoon ?
on Friday there will still be this workshop .
it could only be that it is over earlier .
how long will your workshop last ?
only these two days , but on Saturday I am still free .
yes , at the weekend , I have got no time .
that is really difficult .
how about Monday afterwards ?
yes , I would have time at about two $ P- $ M .
oh , that will be tight , because I am already meeting Bill at three $ P- $ M .
but what about six $ P- $ M ?
on Monday at six $ P- $ M ?
yes , that would be a good time .
okay , six $ P- $ M on Monday .
then we can directly to to the F &quot; acherbad .
okay , I am looking forward to it .
okay , see you then .
bye .
bye .
hello Tobias , I have still got some questions about this algorithm .
hello Robert , which algorithm ?
that stupid Boyer-Moore-Algorithm . perhaps you can explain it to me again some time ?
oh yes , but it is very difficult .
it will take me a bit longer to explain it to you .
what do you think how long we will need ?
oh , looking at you , I think we will definitely need two hours .
okay , let us say three hours .
have you got anything planned this afternoon ?
but afterwards I would have time .
it makes no sense to explain to to you so late .
how about tomorrow ?
yes , then we could get started tomorrow right in the morning .
at eight o &apos;clock ?
oh , that is not possible because I have to prepare a lecture at nine .
it would be possible at twelve .
I am sorry but at twelve I have already got an appointment for a business lunch .
but at two $ P- $ M I would be free again .
that would also suit me .
where shall we meet ?
we could meet in the library .
fine , then we will meet on Friday at two $ P- $ M in the information science library .
okay , but you do mean Friday , the eighth of September , do not you ?
yes , I do .
okay , maybe shortly after two $ P- $ M .
yes , fine , I can wait
okay .
it would be nice if I could come to understand it then .
bye .
I hope so .
fine , bye .
hello , Robert . nice to see you .
just imagine Microsoft rang me up lately .
they absolutely want a program from me .
I only believe I cannot quite manage that on my own .
if you have time , would you like to help me ?
yes , I have got some time left , so I could squeeze in another order .
what is it all about ?
it is about a programme on fixing appointments .
I myself would need it at the moment because my agenda is very full .
yes , but we would have to fix a meeting .
no , no , everything is booked then .
you see , that is just what I would need a programme for .
how about Friday afternoon ?
on Friday I am away the whole day .
but how about next week on Tuesday ?
I will be almost the entire next week at Microsoft &apos; s in order to discuss the programme .
I would only have time on Friday afternoon .
Friday afternoon is okay , by then we will have more information and can arrange everything between ourselves .
that is great , yes .
then we will best meet for lunch on Friday , at twelve ?
yes , that is okay .
fine , see you on Friday then .
bye .
bye .
hello , Mr Schulz .
hello , Mr Gunreben .
how are you ?
oh , today I am quite well again .
I have got a problem with a client for whom we developed a programme together .
he is not satisfied with some options .
do you have time to deal with this problem ?
oh , are you thinking of the Microsoft order ?
yes , exactly .
they claim that we have written some routines wrongly .
yes , I can still remember that .
maybe we should fix a business talk .
that would be exactly the right thing .
would you have time as early as this afternoon ?
yes , this afternoon would still suit me .
fine , it is best if you come to my office this afternoon .
around two o &apos;clock ?
could we also meet at the computer centre ?
that would be a worse possibility because I have got all the documents in my office .
two o &apos;clock , I thought .
okay , that is fine .
see you then , bye .
bye .
I will also bring my documents .
bye .
so ,
as you know ,
we should meet in the next two or three weeks because of that important matter ,
and now we should fix a date .
when do you have time in the next few days ?
well , starting today , I would be free again on the twentieth of July .
in the morning or in the afternoon ?
basically I have time the whole day .
great , I am also free in the morning .
how about nine o &apos;clock ?
yes , that suits me .
okay ? then we will have our meeting from nine till about twelve o &apos;clock .
no problem .
so , Ulrich , I do not have time on the date we fixed , now I would like to fix another one .
when would you have time in August ?
I have an appointment on almost every day .
so now we must look on which half of the day we have time .
for example on the first of August in the afternoon .
would that suit you ?
the first of August is bad because I only have a short period of free time between two and three $ P- $ M , and I do not know if that is enough time to get anywhere .
well , the second of August in the morning then .
how about that ?
here , it would have to be before half past ten .
we would have to finish before half past ten ?
yes , that is right .
that means we should meet at eight thirty then ?
yes , if you have time then , we should get finished with our meeting .
it is not so much anyway .
so , as far as I am concerned , we can choose that date .
eight thirty , no problem . Wednesday , second of August , ninety five .
okay , confirmed .
so , today is the sixteenth of August and we should meet in the next few days for three hours .
next week , from the twenty second onwards , I will be on holiday for a week , and I will not have time on the twenty first either .
now the question is , and tomorrow and the day after I have got no time .
oh , that is difficult .
now the question is , do you happen to have time on the thirtieth of August after three $ P- $ M ?
I am sorry , you have got bad luck .
exactly at three $ P- $ M I have got a meeting .
that means , if you are on holiday that week , we would have to take a date in September .
that means on the thirty first of August , too , you do not happen to have time ?
no , on that day , I have got a seminar that lasts the whole day .
that means it would really only be possible again in September .
basically , well , I will make a suggestion .
so , I never have time for a whole day at a time .
how about the fifth of September , in the morning ?
very good .
I am off on that morning .
so , fifth of September , let us say at nine o &apos;clock ?
yes , that is okay .
yes , hello , Ulrich .
for the next meeting we have to organize ,
I would have simple dates ,
the twenty second , for example ,
I would be free the whole day .
but basically I would prefer to arrange the meeting already before the twenty second .
when would you be free ?
well , I am free comparatively often .
I am free the whole day on the fifteenth and twenty first of September ,
but the twenty second in the afternoon would definitely be an alternative .
however , I am already free on the eight in the afternoon , that is tomorrow .
make a suggestion .
yes , that suits me fine because I am also free tomorrow afternoon .
then let us fix this date .
yes , okay , so at three $ P- $ M tomorrow .
so , hello Dietmar .
this is the first of October
it is time to meet again .
so in the next two weeks there will be another three hour meeting .
my suggestion would be the thirteenth of October ,
I will be free the whole day ,
but apart from that I am often available for half a day .
if you do not have time on the thirteenth , please make another suggestion .
the thirteenth is great , but not before ten thirty , but since this would not give us enough time before lunch ,
I would suggest to choose the afternoon right away .
so on Friday , thirteenth of October , two $ P- $ M , our meeting .
yes , okay .
hello , Wolfgang .
I am glad that I have met you .
hello , Martin .
why ?
I have got a few questions to ask you , about the programme .
oh yes .
then let us fix a date
then we can get together in the next two weeks and talk about it .
okay , fine .
however , I have arranged a few other things first .
let us see .
so , tomorrow I have got a lecture in the morning and practical training in the afternoon .
Friday would be fine , I am off then .
on Friday , I am quite busy .
however , we need quite a while .
I think , about three hours .
I do not feel like it this weekend .
how about Monday ?
yes , Monday would be okay , however , I am only free in the afternoon .
in the morning I have got a lecture and another meeting .
shortly after three o &apos;clock , I have got to take Michael to the airport .
unfortunately , I do not know when I will be back .
perhaps this is not so good .
in the morning I have got another lecture until eleven , and immediately afterwards another meeting .
but from two o &apos;clock onwards I would be free .
okay , that is not bad .
on Tuesday I must only prepare a seminar , and I can do that before or afterwards .
yes , fine , then we can meet at two o &apos;clock .
okay , fine .
see you on Tuesday , bye .
hello , Martin .
we wanted to get together soon because of our seminar .
does it suit you tomorrow ?
hey , Wolfgang .
oh yes , true , I remember .
tomorrow is perhaps not so good .
how about Thursday morning ?
on Thursday morning I have a lecture until a quarter to eleven .
that is bad because at two o &apos;clock in the afternoon I have practical training ,
but on Friday I would be free the whole day .
oh yes , I do have to go to the dentist , but I think I will be back at four .
basically yes , but how long do you think will we need ?
if we need three hours , that might be a little late .
perhaps we should see if it is possible a week later .
yes , fine .
okay , let us see .
Monday is a bank holiday .
how about Wednesday ?
on Wednesday morning , I already have a meeting with Fred . but Wednesday afternoon would be possible .
okay , fine , around one o &apos;clock ?
one o &apos;clock is perhaps a little early .
at two perhaps .
okay , let us do it like that .
fine then we will do it on Wednesday at two .
see you then , bye .
hello , Wolfgang .
hey , Martin .
we must urgently meet some time next week .
are you free some time ?
yes , sure , we can do that .
how about Monday morning at your place ?
that will not be possible .
is it possible in the afternoon ?
that is bad because I have got my colloquium at two o &apos;clock .
we should better find another day .
for Tuesday and Wednesday I have already arranged to spend the days with Jochen .
on Thursday , I have an exam at two o &apos;clock .
it will be bad before two , of course .
but on Friday I will be free the whole day .
yes , Friday would not be bad because I have not arranged anything yet .
yes , fine .
let us meet on Friday then .
do you prefer in the morning or at noon ?
does not matter .
let us say in the afternoon .
at one o &apos;clock ?
yes , okay , then we will meet at one o &apos;clock .
yes , fine .
see you then . bye .
hello Martin .
we should get together soon because of our practical training .
oh dear . you are right .
what time are you thinking of ?
I can not make it today because I have a meeting with Gudrun .
how about next week ?
at the beginning of next week I will have a lot to do , but from Wednesday onwards .
yes , Wednesday afternoon is fine .
I will be free on Wednesday the whole day long .
what time would suit you ?
make a suggestion .
I do not care .
then I would say , around half past two ?
okay , yes , that suits me , too .
okay .
then we will meet on Wednesday , that is the twenty sixth , at half past two .
yes , okay . see you then .
bye .
see you then . bye .
hello , Wolfgang .
hello , Martin .
we must meet again because of the visit to the company next week .
oh yes , it is good that you are reminding me
I would have almost forgotten it .
when would it suit you ?
perhaps we should not wait so long .
do you still have time today or tomorrow ?
today is bad .
let me think .
what about tomorrow ?
tomorrow I have a meeting with Uli .
it will probably last until eleven .
and at noon I will also have practical training .
this will not work either .
but on Friday I would be free the whole day long .
on Friday , I have a seminar the whole day long .
and how about Monday ?
on Monday morning I will meet Mr Meier .
and from half past three onwards I have another colloquium .
so , either we will do it quickly in the time between my two appointments , or we will do it on Tuesday morning .
I would be free the whole morning .
I do not know if that is enough time .
we do need a few hours .
on Tuesday morning , I already have a group meeting .
do you have time in the afternoon ,
on Tuesday ?
no , that is not possible
I must go to the library then .
and Wednesday is bad again because I must prepare the publication for the $ J $ B $ A .
Thursday at five $ P- $ M is the deadline for submission .
this means it would be best on Friday .
oh , that is really bad .
from Wednesday till the end of the week , I will be away .
so it is possible again from the twenty sixth onwards .
that is a Monday .
will you be available then ?
Monday morning would be possible , yes .
Monday at noon I have got my colloquium
but in the morning , I am off .
okay then .
fine .
so let us say Monday .
but comparatively early .
nine o &apos;clock , does that suit you ?
yes , okay , I agree .
so we will meet at nine .
&quot; ahm well I think we need to meet , for another , &quot; ahm two hours . &quot; ahm to discuss this matter further .
&quot; ahm what is a convenient time , for like a two hour slot , within the next couple weeks , for you .
well , I am free on Monday , except for , ten to twelve in the morning .
and I am free , on Tuesday , in the afternoon .
and , actually , I am also free , Wednesday and Thursday in the afternoon . and , Thursday all day .
well &quot; ahm actually , next week is not , that , great for me . because , &quot; ah Wednesday through Friday , I am like in seminars all day .
&quot; ahm so ,
how does the week of either the thirty first of May , or sometime the , &quot; ahm beginning of June , look for you .
well , I am , out of town . Monday through Wednesday , of that week .
I will be free , that Thursday the third , in the afternoon , or Friday morning .
and again I am also still free , afternoons of Monday and Tuesday next week .
well then , &quot; ahm Thursday afternoon looks good .
&quot; ahm do you want to , do it , earlier in the afternoon ?
or would you like to meet , later in the afternoon .
do you have a preference I mean .
well , I have a meeting from ten to eleven .
so after that , I probably would like to have some lunch and stuff .
so how about one o &apos;clock .
&quot; ahm , great . &quot; ahm I think , one to , three $ P- $ M , would be fine .
would you , like to meet , in , your office ? or my office .
your office is fine .
okay , so then , &quot; ahm I will see you , Thursday , June third , at one o &apos;clock , in , my office .
see you then , have a nice seminar .
well ,
&quot; ahm I think , &quot; ahm in a couple weeks , I should &quot; ahm have this program , done , so we can talk some more about the analysis .
so , what would be a good time , to , meet again .
well , we , get down to the week of the twenty sixth ,
I am busy , &quot; ahm on Monday and Tuesday , I am free Wednesday afternoon ,
that would be the twenty eighth .
&quot; ahm I am in a meeting , from two to four thirty on Wednesday ,
&quot; ahm Thursday afternoon is good ,
but then , I am going to be out of town , from July thirtieth , through , August third .
so if we can not , make it , on , Thursday afternoon ,
we will have to ,
you know ,
look for something between the fourth and sixth of August .
well I am afraid I am busy , all afternoon that Thursday , so if you move all the way to the fourth of August ,
I am free in the afternoon there , or the morning of the fifth .
&quot; ahm I can meet either , &quot; ahm Wednesday , after one $ P- $ M , or , Friday morning .
do you have a preference ? or , &quot; ahm if not ,
you know ,
maybe we should just &quot; ah , make it , Wednesday .
&quot; ahm oh I am out of town on Friday . so I have a preference for Wednesday .
if you have a meeting , until one , maybe a two o &apos;clock , time , would be better than a one o &apos;clock time .
yeah , that would probably be a good idea , &quot; ahm in case it runs over .
&quot; ahm alright , so why do not we meet , &quot; ahm two o &apos;clock , and why do not I come to your office .
sounds good to me , and that way , you will have an extra week ,
to do all the stuff that you wanted to do , before the next meeting .
okay , well , &quot; ahm I will see you then , &quot; ahm have a , productive week .
bye .
bye bye
Patty &quot; ahm we need to get together to talk about this secretary project , this anything that floats race .
&quot; ahm , what is a good time for you .
well next week , I am out , the twenty seventh through the twenty ninth ,
I have some meetings on the twenty fifth and the twenty sixth ,
&quot; ah the following week I am out on February first , and , some meetings the rest of the week .
how about , does it have to be during the day ?
or would you prefer in the evening .
&quot; ahm probably , some time between nine and five , would be good ,
I do not really look forward to , meeting over , business , after five o &apos;clock ,
do you think we will need an hour ? if so , how about , the twenty sixth , three to four ?
you know what we probably need &quot; ahm ,
probably maybe the two or three hours ,
and actually the twenty sixth , I am in a seminar from nine to four ,
&quot; ahm are you in the twenty seventh ?
the only thing I have on the twenty seventh , is from ten to eleven , in the morning ,
no ,
the twenty seventh ? through the first of February , I am out of town . how about February the third , at two .
we could do , two to four .
&quot; ah that sounds pretty good .
&quot; ahm I have a meeting from nine thirty to noon ,
and , that will give me some time to catch some lunch ,
and where do you want to meet .
in my office ? or your office .
your office seems to be bigger than mine . let us meet in yours .
on the , third of February , two to four .
sounds good to me ,
ten four good buddy ,
Patty I was wondering &quot; ahm ,
if you wanted to get together sometime &quot; ah I do not know , next week or two , for few hours ,
just to talk about some things , and what is going on with the , support staff ,
sounds good to me , let me look over my schedule , &quot; ah two to three hours you say ?
we could possibly do it , on the twenty seventh , of May ,
I am out of town the thirty first , through June , second .
twenty seventh ,
&quot; ah I have a seminar from nine thirty to four thirty ,
&quot; ahm I take it any earlier in that week is not good for you .
let me see ,
&quot; ahm you are out through June second ?
did you say ?
I am out , through June second ,
but , we could possibly do it on the twenty fourth , but I have a meeting ten to twelve ,
and I needed the afternoon to catch up on some things .
&quot; ahm we could do it , Wednesday the twenty sixth , say , eleven if you want to work through lunch .
let me know .
well actually , the twenty sixth and the twenty eighth ,
now that I look at my calendar ,
I have a seminar from nine thirty to four thirty ,
how about ,
I do not know what you said about Thursday ,
the only thing I have is nine thirty to ten ,
maybe we could get together , at lunch time , or something like that ,
actually , Thursday , the third , sounds good .
I have a meeting , ten to eleven ,
we could meet , &quot; ah around noon ,
that gives me an hour to catch up on some things , and , &quot; ahm we can work on that ,
&quot; ah that sounds good ,
noon &quot; ahm I do not know where you want to go ,
maybe , we could , head out , to maybe the faculty club , or , $ P $ H $ I , or Great Scot ,
and ,
I am not sure what you are into ,
or ,
if you are a vegetarian ,
we could head out to , Paradise on Craig ,
Great Scot sounds fine .
we will meet there , on June third , at noon .
if something changes , give me , a call .
thanks , bye ,
sounds good , you got it ,
Patty , I heard you mention last week that you wanted to , set up a surprise birthday party for , Alex .
&quot; ahm what do you think ?
sounds great to me .
&quot; ah maybe we can get together , and , discuss , the planning , for say , two hours , in the next , couple weeks ,
let me know what your schedule is like .
okay , &quot; ah let me see .
actually , July twenty sixth and twenty seventh looks good ,
&quot; ah the twenty sixth afternoon , or the twenty seventh , before three $ P- $ M ,
&quot; ah geez . I am out of town the thirtieth through the third , I am in San Francisco .
or either even next Wednesday after one o &apos;clock , any of those sound good for you ?
actually , the twenty sixth , and the twenty seventh I will be at a seminar all day ,
&quot; ah the twenty eighth in the afternoon I could meet , for , say an hour and a half to two ,
twenty ninth is out ,
and you are out of town the thirtieth through the , third ?
&quot; ah if that is the case we could meet possibly Wednesday , afternoon , after one ,
sounds good to me , &quot; ah the rest of the week does not look too good . let me know .
how about the fourth at , two o &apos;clock .
maybe from two to four ,
and then maybe in the meantime , we can kind of get some ideas what we want to do . &quot; ahm do you have any ideas just off the top of your head ?
right now , &quot; ahm I really do not have any ideas ,
but , that will give me some time to think , up something really nice for him since ,
we all like him so well ,
&quot; ahm then I will see you Wednesday , at two $ P- $ M let us meet in , the conference room down the hall from me .
I will send you , mail ,
regarding , the location .
thanks ,
see you then ,
bye .
&quot; ah that sounds good , Patty .
I do not know ,
I was thinking about having someone parachute in for him .
what do you think about that ?
as long as it is done tastefully , I do not think he would mind .
but we will keep that as an option ,
thanks ,
that sounds good Patty , I will &quot; ah , keep it at that .
okay , see you then , bye .
well Marcy ,
looks like we , need to schedule another meeting , in the next couple of weeks ,
&quot; ahm most days , Monday through Friday , I have &quot; ah , classes or meetings from , nine until twelve .
so ,
&quot; ah seems like to me the best time would be , in the afternoon .
&quot; ahm what afternoons are you available in the next couple weeks .
okay .
I look to be available ,
between two and three on the twenty eighth ,
after twelve on the twenty ninth , after two , on the thirtieth , and , let us see . between two , and three thirty , on the first .
and that is really it for me in the afternoons .
okay ,
actually I forgot to say that what we need is a two hour meeting . &quot; ahm so ,
you gave me a couple of , what seemed to be one and a half hour times , how about two hour times .
&quot; ah twenty ninth is not good for me in the afternoon ,
I do have a seminar all day that day ,
and the afternoon of the thirtieth is also , &quot; ah booked from two thirty to five .
&quot; ahm do you have two hour block on the first ?
in the afternoon ?
no I do not have anything longer than an hour and a half all day on the first ,
&quot; ahm let us see ,
is it , every day ? until twelve ? that you are busy ?
because I have a lot of mornings free .
actually ,
on the morning of the sixth ,
well I do not have anything scheduled at all , on the sixth .
so , we could do something on the morning of the sixth ,
how would that be for you .
I think I am going to have someone else start , keeping my calendar ,
because I am out of town on the sixth . wait how about ,
let us see .
I really have to rule out the whole week of the fourth . because , I do not have a two hour block at all that whole week . so let us narrow down , to the week of the twenty seventh ,
&quot; ahm hm I really , do not have , a two hour block , between nine and five , that , whole week , except for in the mornings .
oops &quot; ah on , the first , I have a meeting from ten to eleven . but , we could meet , well no .
if you could meet from say eleven to one , on Friday the first , how would that be .
no , sorry , first is still bad , I do not have any , &quot; ah two hours slots at all .
&quot; ah would have to keep it here are the times I actually have .
before one on the twenty seventh ,
before twelve , on the twenty eighth , &quot; ah after twelve on the twenty ninth . and after two on the thirtieth .
those , are the only two hour slots I have . if we do not find something in that time ,
&quot; ah maybe we can go to the weekend or something .
okay . looks like we are going to have to go to the weekend .
&quot; ahm on Saturday , &quot; ah I already have , an appointment from eleven to one , $ P- $ M .
on the second .
but other than that , &quot; ah I am free . how is your Saturday .
&quot; ah , okay , I guess we will do it one o &apos;clock on the second .
one to three .
it sounds good .
alright ?
great .
see you then ,
okay Marcy ,
looks like we , need to schedule a , another two hour meeting , here , &quot; ahm let us see ,
&quot; ah next week ,
the week of the twenty second ,
I have , &quot; ah two hour blocks available ,
from three to five on the twenty third ,
&quot; ahm from twelve to two on the twenty fifth , and , either before twelve , or after one thirty , on the twenty sixth .
&quot; ah are any of those times good for you ?
sorry , no .
I have something the afternoon of the twenty third , and , I am out of town the twenty fifth through the twenty seventh ,
&quot; ahm how about the week of the twenty ninth . &quot; ah wait I can tell you right off the bat ,
that , Friday the third is not good ,
Thursday the second is not good ,
but any morning ,
twenty ninth ,
thirtieth , or first .
are all good .
well , unfortunately , &quot; ah my mornings , the twenty ninth , thirtieth , and first , are all full .
&quot; ahm on those three days ,
let us see .
I would have time on the twenty ninth , between twelve and three ,
&quot; ah on the thirtieth , after twelve ,
&quot; ahm and &quot; ah I do not have a two hour block free on the first .
so either the twenty ninth or thirtieth , how are those for you .
no ,
sorry ,
none of those are , going to work &quot; ahm it looks like we might have to go to the weekend again .
how does the ,
gee I would hate to do it on a Sunday ,
how does , &quot; ah before twelve , or after two , on Saturday the fourth look .
well , Saturday the fourth , is free , all day for me .
&quot; ahm so how about if we do it before twelve , say ten to twelve ?
on Saturday the fourth ?
&quot; ah yes . ten to twelve , on Saturday the fourth , looks good .
thanks .
can I meet with you , sometime in the next two weeks . what days are good for you .
&quot; ahm well I have some , free time on , almost every day .
&quot; ahm except for Fridays , Fridays are bad .
&quot; ahm so any day besides Friday is probably , we can probably , work out a time .
well next week I am out of town , Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday , so , perhaps , Monday afternoon ?
&quot; ahm , well Monday , at noon , would work , but , I could not do anything later than that .
unfortunately I have a , a lunch meeting , from twelve to two .
so next , week looks bad , how about the next week ,
&quot; ahm that is fine . how about &quot; ah , next Thursday . after lunch .
that is , not good for me , because I have , meetings all afternoon , how about , Tuesday ? afternoon ?
that is fine , how about , Tuesday at one then .
that is good for me too .
the sixteenth ?
yep , the sixteenth . so , next Tuesday at one then .
can we meet , next , Tuesday ?
for a lunch , meeting ?
and
&quot; ahm well I could meet at , at twelve thirty , would that do ?
no that would not give us two hours .
how about , Thursday afternoon ,
&quot; ah at one ?
that would be good for me ,
oh wait , that says two thirty , not twelve thirty .
&quot; ahm so , we can not meet that Thursday .
so , how about the next Thursday ,
at one ?
on the eighth ?
that would be good for me .
&quot; ah that is fine for me too , so , one o &apos;clock on the eighth then .
can we meet on , the twenty fifth , in the morning ?
no the twenty fifth is , really bad .
&quot; ahm in fact ,
like ,
&quot; ahm three o &apos;clock Tuesday would be like the only time next week , we could meet .
that is bad for me too .
how about , the next week . maybe Wednesday afternoon ?
that is fine with me .
so it is Wednesday , February third .
okay , that is a date ,
can we meet , on the thirty first , in the morning ?
no I am out of town from the , thirty first to the third . I am sorry from the thirty first to the second .
&quot; ahm we could meet on the , third , in the afternoon ,
how about at one .
that is good for me .
that is , fine by me ,
could we meet , on the twenty seventh , in the morning ?
no I am busy , all day , on the twenty seventh .
&quot; ahm do you want to meet in the morning , how about , &quot; ah next Friday ,
unfortunately , I am out of town . Friday , and then the next , Monday and Tuesday . how about , Wednesday ,
the fourth .
in the afternoon ?
maybe around two ?
&quot; ahm Wednesday is okay , &quot; ah how about one , on the fourth .
would one thirty be okay with you ?
&quot; ahm one thirty would be fine ,
okay then , that is fine .
&quot; ah could we meet again sometime in the next two weeks ?
oops ,
the next two weeks are kind of blown out for me ,
I am completely on vacation from the third , to the fourteenth .
after that I do have some time though .
okay , well , &quot; ah , what about the seventeenth , I have got that , whole day free .
okay , &quot; ah ,
the seventeenth . is pretty much completely used up with a seminar for me ,
going to find whoever scheduled , me for that and , shoot them .
the eighteenth , I have the morning free , and also noon until two ,
the nineteenth , I have most of the day free ,
at least , after lunch .
&quot; ah the eighteenth is kind of full for me , but I think I could squeeze you in from noon to two , yeah .
okay , well ,
since we want to get this , out of the way , as soon as possible , and it is already been pushed off more than two weeks ,
let us say on the eighteenth from noon until two .
that will work for me .
alright , sounds good , I will talk to you more about it then .
when would be good for you to schedule another meeting .
&quot; ahm tomorrow . Tuesday the first .
&quot; ahm I am free from eleven , until three ?
if we can not do it then ,
my next time free is Monday the seventh ,
because I am going on vacation .
&quot; ah wow , sounds like we are going to be missing each other for a while here .
I have got , Monday , or Tuesday off , and , a seminar on Wednesday .
then I am going to be out of town , the beginning of next week ,
looks like the earliest , would be , Thursday , afternoon ?
hey this is kind of amusing . Thursday is my day off ,
Friday , I am free from noon until the end of the day ,
oh wait .
I have got to eat lunch somewhere ,
Monday the fourteenth ,
I am totally free ,
hm how about any of those times .
I have Friday the eleventh and Monday the fourteenth wide open .
okay .
let us say ,
Friday then , from one until three ,
because that will give me , a lunch hour in the middle .
how does that work for you ?
sounds fine .
okay . I will see you then .
okay .
I really do not feel very good about this situation ,
I think we ought to talk about it a little bit more .
how about Monday ?
wait a second .
which Monday . &quot; ahm because I think I have time , on each of the Mondays .
at least in the morning .
&quot; ah wait this is the twelfth . &quot; ahm how is the &quot; ah , twenty first for you .
nope . still out of town then ?
&quot; ahm the twenty second , I have all the afternoon free ,
twenty third , I have the whole day free ,
also the twenty seventh and twenty eighth .
the twenty sixth , I have the morning free ,
the twenty second I have got the morning free but the afternoon busy , but &quot; ah I am free on the morning of the twenty third ,
okay . &quot; ahm how about we go for the morning of the twenty third , say , ten to noon ?
I have the rest of the day free if that time does not work for you .
sounds fine , I will see you here then .
okay . &quot; ah can we meet again sometime soon ?
okay I know what you are thinking , you are thinking beginning of next week , forget it .
the earliest I am going to be here at all is Monday , the ninth .
&quot; ahm I have it totally free , the tenth , hey , six $ P- $ M ?
hosers . geez .
also I have the the eleventh and twelfth free , and Tuesday morning , Tuesday the tenth .
you have to work until six on the , tenth too ?
&quot; ah , so do I , what are they trying to do to us ?
&quot; ah I do have , &quot; ahm Monday afternoon free though , I think .
okay . let us say , Monday afternoon , Monday the ninth , from one until three .
how about that .
could go a little later than one ?
my class gets out exactly then . let us say , &quot; ah two to four ?
okay . Monday the ninth , two $ P- $ M to four $ P- $ M .
that works fine for me . I guess I will see you there .
&quot; ah okay . could we , &quot; ah meet to discuss this further ?
okay . I guess we need to do this as soon as possible .
Monday looks pretty nasty for me , I kind of like to eat lunch .
how about Tuesday in the afternoon ?
Tuesday is bad for me because I am going to be out of town , from then , until Thursday .
does Monday work then okay ?
&quot; ahm hm eleven , to one , or noon , to two would work for me ,
or ,
well ,
that would be too early .
what do you think about Monday .
&quot; ah I have got eleven to one free , I am busy after two though .
okay ,
I think eleven to one would probably be our best bet then ,
&quot; ahm I have a meeting from two to four ,
but , any time from eleven until two looks good .
&quot; ahm could just eat lunch late .
eleven to one then ?
sounds fine ,
okay . well , see you Monday the eighth &quot; ah , at eleven then .
same place ?
hm , too many years role playing .
starting to jump out of scenario .
yeah , same place .
when would be a good time for you to continue this .
well ,
Tuesday ,
the sixth ,
looks like a pretty good time for me right off , &quot; ahm the next week I have a vacation and some other things to do .
I am going to be out of town , &quot; ah Tuesday and Wednesday ,
I may have some time Monday , though , or &quot; ah the following week ,
oops , I guess we better look into the following week , then .
&quot; ah this Thursday and Friday , are no good for me ,
Tuesday and Wednesday are no good for you ,
next week , Monday and Tuesday I can not do anything ,
how about next week Wednesday and Thursday .
that would be the fourteenth , and the fifteenth .
also , Friday of next week I have the whole day open .
&quot; ah , next Wednesday I have some time in the morning ,
next Wednesday I can go from ten to noon ?
but , I have a doctor &apos;s appointment . from nine until ten ? the whole afternoon is free ,
okay , well let us say that it is &quot; ah Wednesday the fourteenth , from ten $ A- $ M until noon .
okay . I will see you then .
Mr Sullivan .
yes , &quot; ahm so , in the next two weeks , when can you meet ?
hm well , let me check my calendar here , &quot; ahm we are on the twenty fourth .
well ,
the twenty seventh I have class from nine twelve ,
so the afternoon is free , and on the twenty eighth also ,
the twenty ninth is totally full .
how do those days look for you .
well , looks like &quot; ahm twenty seventh morning , would be great for me .
&quot; ahm twenty eighth morning would also be fine .
&quot; ahm twenty ninth is pretty busy , &quot; ahm afternoon , might work , or very early morning .
well our schedules just do not match up at all ,
do they . because &quot; ahm twenty seventh and twenty eighth mornings are horrible for me and afternoons are fine .
twenty ninth I think we can agree is horrible for both of us , and , &quot; ah let us see ,
on the thirtieth ,
the thirtieth is pretty horrible too .
how about &quot; ahm the first full week of October .
well ,
I am really sort of sorry but it looks like &quot; ahm ,
I will be busy the entire first week of October .
&quot; ahm how about the Friday . the first .
well , I have a meeting from , ten $ A- $ M until eleven $ P- $ M , other than that I am free .
so , when are you free .
hm upon looking at my calendar , it looks like &quot; ah , that day may not work out so well after all .
&quot; ahm when did you say you were free on Thursday ?
well on Thursday , I am free from , twelve o &apos;clock , until two thirty ,
that is about it unless you want to meet after five o &apos;clock that is .
nope ,
after five will certainly not work for me .
&quot; ahm how about Saturday ,
the second . &quot; ah might you be free to meet &quot; ahm after one $ P- $ M .
well , it is a Saturday but , after , one $ P- $ M would be fine .
how about one thirty , would that work for you ?
one thirty sounds great .
okay then , I will see you at one thirty on Saturday , until about three thirty .
wonderful .
I will look forward to it also . you have a good day .
Mr Sullivan , I would really like to meet with you for about two hours to discuss this a little further .
when in the next two weeks would be good for you ?
well ,
it looks like , &quot; ahm next Monday and Tuesday , &quot; ahm in the morning would be fine .
or even Wednesday in the morning .
&quot; ahm after that I will be out of town for a bit though .
&quot; ah goodness this is going to be interesting to schedule ,
because , I have class , &quot; ah , Monday in the morning , from nine until twelve ,
and , Tuesday in the morning , I have got a meeting from ten to twelve so well ,
I hate to ask you this , but if you would be able to meet at eight , I could do it ,
or , Wednesday ,
I have class again from nine to twelve ,
so ,
let us see if we could work something out here .
well ,
I am very sorry , but &quot; ahm , eight o &apos;clock just will not work &quot; ahm how about at ,
&quot; ahm would you be free , at , one o &apos;clock , on Monday ?
or for that matter , at one o &apos;clock on Wednesday ?
unfortunately , no I am not .
I have a meeting at one thirty on both well ,
I have a meeting at one thirty on , Tuesday , and I have class at one thirty on Wednesday .
I am free at three o &apos;clock on Tuesday , and I am free at three thirty on Wednesday .
perhaps we could get together then ?
or somewhere around then ?
nope , I am meeting with &quot; ah people from other companies &quot; ahm both days , at that time .
&quot; ahm how about the next week . &quot; ahm let us see . would either Monday or Tuesday morning of the next week work ?
well let us see ,
Monday morning again I have class from nine until twelve ,
and on the thirtieth I have a meeting with the other professors from , ten until twelve .
so again ,
I do not like eight o &apos;clock either ,
but , on the thirtieth ,
which is Tuesday ,
I could meet either you from eight until ten , or any time after twelve o &apos;clock noon would be fine . would either of those work for you ?
nope , &quot; ahm unfortunately they would not .
&quot; ahm see there is always , Wednesday morning , &quot; ahm if Wednesday morning does not work out ,
then , looks like we may have to , &quot; ah squeeze into a Saturday again .
hm let me see ,
well ,
Wednesday morning again is no good ,
I do teach class from nine until twelve , and from one thirty until three thirty .
would you have time in the evening .
I would like to try not to do it on a Saturday this time .
perhaps from , five o &apos;clock or six o &apos;clock on , Wednesday evening ?
no , I am very sorry , but my &quot; ahm evenings are are generally taken up &quot; ahm ,
I have got to play tennis . so , I believe that &quot; ahm how about Saturday ,
the fourth ?
could you possibly meet with me at say , two thirty ?
well , if nothing else will work out then , I think I could put it in on Saturday at two thirty .
would you like to have lunch ?
a late lunch would be &quot; ah wonderful .
okay , see you at two thirty on Saturday .
great .
I will see you then .
have a good day .
hi Danny , now that we have finished our last meeting ,
we need to , arrange another one within the next two weeks ,
and I am looking at my schedule , and the days that I would have free ,
so we could meet and get it over with at a reasonable time would be the sixteenth , or the nineteenth .
what do you think of that ,
okay .
how about the sixteenth ,
I am done at noon ,
we , could have lunch together and then have the meeting from one to three ? how does that sound .
okay let us do that .
&quot; ah we could meet for lunch , at Dave and Andy &apos;s .
and eat lots of ice cream . and gain weight .
and then we could meet , from one to three ,
the ice cream sounds good , but I do not like the gaining weight part .
they tell me though that when you , eat ice cream , that all the calories go out the window ,
hello Dan , it is me again , it is time for another one of those wonderful meetings ,
and , I am looking at my schedule ,
the times that I would have free in the next two weeks , for us to meet at a reasonable time would be ,
the , first of April , or , the fifth , or the eighth .
do you have any of those times free ?
okay ,
the &quot; ah , first of April , I am pretty much , busy all day .
&quot; ahm except in the morning , before , ten ,
but that would be uncool .
the fifth , I am busy , all day also ,
and the eighth , I am free , after ten o &apos;clock ,
so it looks like the eighth is when we can meet .
the eighth sounds good ,
we can do the lunch thing again , except we will go and get , &quot; ah salads this time ,
no ice cream ,
how about ,
&quot; ah well I have , lunch at eleven thirty ,
and then we will meet from , twelve thirty to two thirty .
what do you think ,
okay ,
that sounds good to me ,
&quot; ahm I will meet you at eleven thirty ,
and then we will do our meeting from twelve thirty , to , &quot; ah two thirty .
bye .
okay Danny ,
now that this meeting is over ,
we need to schedule another one so we continue ,
to get our work done on this project , and ,
the times that , I would have free , coming up , would be on the twenty fifth , in the morning ,
twenty seventh in the afternoon ,
&quot; ah February third , in the afternoon , and that is about it ,
do you have any of those times free ?
&quot; ahm seems to me like , we should meet , on the third ,
Wednesday .
after two o &apos;clock so let us get together , right at two and I will rush from my earlier meeting , and &quot; ahm ,
and we will be done by five ,
because everything else , is booked ,
and I am out of town ,
I am really busy this month ,
it is just a bad month for me ,
okay ,
the third sounds good ,
and , we can get done , just in time so each of us can go to where we need to go for the evening .
&quot; ah sounds like a date , how about you ,
is that good ?
yeah , it is excellent .
let us &quot; ah let us do it , the third sounds good to me .
okay we need to set up a schedule for this meeting ,
&quot; ahm how , does , your schedule look , for , next week .
well ,
Monday and Tuesday ,
that is the twenty seventh and twenty eighth ,
both mornings are good , and Wednesday afternoon is good .
okay ,
it looks like we will have to look into Thursday or , Friday then , &quot; ahm let us see ,
do you have time between , well , at lunch time ,
twelve ,
and , two , on Thursday , or , sometime Friday afternoon ?
&quot; ah no both Thursday and Friday , are really tight for me .
I do not know if you want to try a Saturday , do you think , Saturday afternoon is a possibility ?
&quot; ahm it depends on how ,
&quot; ah the , next week is for you . maybe , maybe Monday or Tuesday , of next week .
actually &quot; ahm Monday Tuesday and Wednesday ,
all three I am out of town and Thursday and Friday , &quot; ahm my seminars last ten to five ,
so it , kind of looks like it has to be the weekend .
how did you say your , Wednesday , was , &quot; ah the twenty ninth .
Wednesday afternoon is good , &quot; ahm anything after twelve , we could make it a lunch meeting ,
&quot; ahm wondering how long we actually have to meet . &quot; ahm how long do you , think , this would take .
I think to be safe we should plan on , two hours ,
in that case it looks like we do , have to touch into Saturday .
&quot; ahm how does your Saturday look .
&quot; ahm I have got something , between eleven and one ,
anything after one is , good for me , we could say , one thirty ?
one thirty is good ,
okay , we make it one thirty , Saturday , October second .
see you there .
I will bring beer .
&quot; ah my God , are we going to meet during , Thanksgiving hm ?
well I am going to be out of town from the , twenty fifth through Saturday ,
&quot; ahm no , well yeah ,
through Saturday ,
I figure ,
same as before , a two hour spread , which leaves me , &quot; ahm Monday morning , and &quot; ah Tuesday morning ,
and , yeah Monday Tuesday Wednesday the mornings are all good for me ,
did I just do something wrong ,
so moving right along , to &quot; ah ,
let us see .
Monday the twenty ninth , the ,
morning is good for me , and I ,
might be able to squeeze in , three to five on , Monday the twenty ninth ,
oh God ,
no that is not going to work for me ,
&quot; ahm let us see .
my mornings look pretty booked , &quot; ahm Tuesdays through Friday .
or actually Monday through Friday , none of my mornings are good at all , &quot; ahm how are your afternoons ,
I could say the same thing about my afternoons ,
you said about you Mondays ,
except ,
like I said ,
&quot; ah just barely three to five on Monday November twenty ninth ,
do you want to try for , how does , &quot; ah the week of the twenty second look to you .
well .
knowing that your Mondays are tight ,
&quot; ah actually the , Monday the twenty second , &quot; ah anywhere between , lunch and three ,
I am okay . I do not know how your , noon to three is on Monday the twenty second ,
actually I was referring to the week , of the twenty second . &quot; ahm on the twenty second itself I can only meet for an hour and a half at lunch time .
well ,
&quot; ahm Wednesday , anything , before three is good for me ,
so , Wednesday ,
between , noon and three ,
can you fit something in ?
not really .
&quot; ahm okay ?
shall we try , for evenings .
well I think we ought to try to keep it between , nine to five . perhaps I am not looking closely enough .
Tuesday , my meeting starts at two .
so , we could go noon to two perhaps , on Tuesday the twenty third of November ,
so , &quot; ahm are your mornings also busy , in the , first week of December ?
yes they are , &quot; ahm nine to twelve . &quot; ahm every day .
well , &quot; ah Saturday December four , I suppose , being a Saturday , we ought to be able to fit something in ,
name your time .
two thirty to , four thirty ?
you got it ,
okay , there we go , Saturday , December four , two thirty to four thirty .
good , thank you ,
thank you ,
Dave I think we need to meet again .
&quot; ahm Monday at three to four I just had a cancellation ,
so I could probably meet from three to five on Monday if it is good for you .
I have forgotten what you said by now , but I think you said Monday three to four .
I have a meeting from two to four .
so how about Tuesday from three to four ?
no ,
Tuesday is bad ,
I am going to be out of town on from Tuesday to Thursday , and the next open time I would have would be the following Tuesday , at ,
say two ,
at twelve thirtyish ,
or anytime thereafter .
Tuesday the sixteenth at twelve thirty is fine for me , I am open all afternoon .
is that okay ?
that is great .
so we will make it , twelve thirty , until two thirty .
I will see you then .
bye .
okay Dave ,
for our next meeting time ,
can we try , March thirtieth Tuesday ,
maybe at , three o &apos;clock to five o &apos;clock ?
I am free , March thirtieth , three to five $ P- $ M ,
so that would be okay ,
if that is alright with you .
okay , you are in , three to five , I will see you then , bye ,
bye ,
no can do ,
I am in a seminar , from , ten to two thirty , on Friday the second ,
&quot; ahm next week , Monday is pretty bad ,
but , Tuesday any , time except two to four , is alright .
you are always catching me when I am out of town .
&quot; ahm I will be back , Wednesday evening , so , Thursday , about twelvish , is good for me .
how about you ,
sure , I am free all Thursday afternoon .
so let us say twelve o &apos;clock Thursday , the eighth ,
okay , see you then ,
bye
hey Dave it is meeting time again .
&quot; ahm the best time I have would be Wednesday ,
January twenty seventh ,
at noon .
so ,
how does that sound for you ?
nope , now I am out of town from the twenty seventh to the twenty ninth .
so that entire week is shot .
how about ,
in fact I am out Monday as well .
how about Tuesday ,
at three to five .
if that is Tuesday , February the second ,
I am out of town maybe we will be at the same place .
&quot; ahm but Wednesday , the third ,
maybe at one sounds good .
how about you ?
nope , on the third I am in meetings , ten to twelve and one to two .
so if there is any other time Wednesday ,
&quot; ah otherwise , Thursday is really bad ,
and Friday is really bad unless you can meet Friday at three to five .
nope , in a seminar on Friday .
did you say you were open after two on Wednesday ?
yes , I am free two to five on Wednesday .
so how about meeting three to five ?
that sounds good , gives me a two hour lunch break .
so I will see you three to five .
say yeah .
so ,
we have covered quite a bit today ,
but I think we should get together again sometime in the next couple of weeks ,
I think it would take , I do no know , at least a couple hours to get through everything else ,
okay , &quot; ah let us see .
today is the twenty fourth ?
&quot; ahm probably next Monday would be bad , but , &quot; ah but maybe Wednesday ? the twenty ninth ?
Wednesday is really bad for me ,
I have got a seminar that goes all day ,
&quot; ahm let us see .
what about , on , Thursday .
during lunch ,
from twelve to two , would that work for you ?
no ,
I will be busy most of the afternoon on Thursday ,
it looks like &quot; ah from my schedule at least ,
we are going to have to go , next week sometime , &quot; ah maybe not .
maybe next Friday ,
Friday the first ,
I , have a meeting that gets over at eleven in the morning ,
any time after that would be okay with me ,
okay , do you think we could do it Friday , between , eleven and twelve thirty ?
I think that would be cutting it pretty tight . I think we have got enough that it is really going to take ,
I do no know , two , two and a half hours .
&quot; ahm what about , the following week . do you have some time then ?
well let us see . I will be out of town from Monday through Wednesday ,
that is the fourth through the sixth ,
and then &quot; ah , Thursday and Friday , the seventh and eighth ,
I will be busy all day too .
but &quot; ah , I will be free that weekend . the weekend before that . the second and third .
okay . well ,
I hate to work on the weekend but ,
I can do it . I am going to be playing tennis , on , the second and that will go until about one in the afternoon ,
so , I could meet you , possibly starting around two on Saturday ,
or anytime on Sunday ,
after about ,
I do no know ,
three in the afternoon would be alright ,
okay &quot; ah either Saturday or Sunday is fine for me . &quot; ah let us do it on Saturday .
&quot; ahm I am free after one so , maybe we can get together at , two fifteen ?
or two thirty or so ?
yeah , two thirty sounds best to me , &quot; ah so Saturday the second at two thirty then .
okay , we will see you then ,
well I think we should get together again sometime , &quot; ahm do you have , time , next week ?
let us see I actually do not have very much time .
what about , on the twenty fifth . from twelve to two . on Thursday November .
no , I will be out of town , &quot; ah from Thursday to Saturday .
&quot; ahm I could , get together with you , maybe Tuesday or Wednesday morning ,
well Wednesday I am busy all day ,
Tuesday the only time I would have would be at three in the afternoon .
yeah ,
I will be busy on Tuesday from two to four thirty ,
so , maybe we should make it for next week sometime ?
&quot; ah in the morning looks like it would be best for me ,
well , boy .
do you want to try for something on the weekend ?
yeah , I think the weekend would be best for me ,
&quot; ahm let us see . I have a meeting on Saturday the fourth ,
from twelve to two , &quot; ah but after two o &apos;clock I am free ,
okay ,
I could do it then ,
at two , on Saturday ,
the fourth ,
or if you wanted to do it on Sunday the twenty eighth , I have got , a lab ,
in the morning so I , could be around after that ,
&quot; ah anytime after I guess noon ,
okay ,
it would probably be better to do it sooner , than later , so ,
yeah let us get together on Sunday the twenty eighth ,
&quot; ahm how about one o &apos;clock .
sounds good , I will see you then ,
okay , would you have two hours , on Thursday afternoon , the third , or Friday , the fourth .
no , that is not good , I am actually on vacation , Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday .
how about &quot; ah , this Tuesday ? tomorrow .
no , &quot; ahm that sounds like this week , does not work .
next week , the earliest I could do it , would be again , Thursday afternoon , or anytime Friday .
okay .
yeah I can not do it on , Thursday .
but Friday , in the afternoon would be good . how about &quot; ah , one to three ?
that is Friday , June eleventh , one , to three ? that is okay , that will work .
great .
let us meet then see you .
okay , I guess we are done .
okay .
&quot; ahm , well the next , ten days are really bad ,
so starting on the twenty first , &quot; ah I could do the twenty first , or the twenty second in the morning , or the twenty third in the morning .
okay , yeah .
&quot; ah twenty first , I will be out of town ,
&quot; ahm twenty second , I only have the afternoon ,
but on the twenty third , I am free , so , we could meet that Friday , on the twenty third .
&quot; ahm either that or this week sometime .
this week is out , &quot; ahm so let us , look at the twenty third , from nine to eleven $ A- $ M ?
it is a little early for me , &quot; ahm let us do it in the afternoon . how about &quot; ah , three to five .
no ,
I am already booked three to five .
&quot; ahm noon to two would work ,
or else it would have to be the week afterwards .
alright , noon to two sounds good .
I will be up by then .
that is the right kind of spirit .
alright , Friday , July twenty third , &quot; ah noon to two $ P- $ M , we will meet the usual place .
bye .
I will see you then .
so , &quot; ah I guess we should have another meeting .
how long do you think it should be for .
well , I think we have quite a bit to talk about , maybe , two hours ?
how does that sound .
deadly , but , let us do it anyways .
okay , do you have any time next week ?
I have got , afternoons on Tuesday and Thursday .
I am out of Tuesday Wednesday Thursday , so , &quot; ahm how about Monday or Friday .
well ,
Monday I could meet from , around eleven thirty until two ,
or ,
yeah Friday is not possible for me ,
I have a seminar all day .
okay , that week is not going to work . how about the week after that .
when are you free .
well ,
again Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , or Wednesday I have all day , or , Monday in the morning would be possible for me .
alright , that sounds good to me .
well let me pencil you in .
okay , I will see you then , Tuesday , the sixteenth , at one $ P- $ M .
so , we should meet again .
&quot; ahm how about right now .
well ,
we have been working on this for quite a while and it would be nice to take a break .
&quot; ahm why do not we see if we can , put it off at least until tomorrow ,
I have got time in the morning .
well , let us see .
this week Friday morning , and early afternoon is good . does that work for you ?
not really ,
&quot; ahm aside from tomorrow morning or early afternoon ,
I think Wednesday afternoon , is the only other time I have this week that is available .
okay , let us look at , next week .
how about , &quot; ahm Monday morning or afternoon , or Friday morning ? or early afternoon ,
anytime on Friday would be possibility .
&quot; ah how about ten o &apos;clock , on Friday morning .
okay , let us do it then . see you at , ten , Friday morning .
okay , see you then .
you want to meet in the same place ?
sure .
alright , see you Friday .
okay , well ,
looks like &quot; ah , we are running short on time ,
and &quot; ah we are going to have to , schedule , a meeting sometime in the next two weeks ?
&quot; ahm so , when are you free next week possibly ?
&quot; ah next week is pretty good for me ,
&quot; ahm I think ,
next week Wednesday , afternoon , would be the best , or Thursday after two o &apos;clock .
hm let me see ,
&quot; ah I am looking at my schedule ,
&quot; ahm Wednesday does not seem to be , too good ,
&quot; ahm actually what am I saying .
&quot; ahm Thursday after two , is anywhere , from , two thirty to five on Thursday fine ?
yes . I have a meeting from ten to twelve , and then another meeting from one to two .
are you free after two o &apos;clock on Thursday ?
okay ,
well ,
looks like as if I , &quot; ah misinterpreted the schedule ,
and I have a meeting from two thirty to five so ,
Thursday is definitely out of the question , &quot; ahm as for &quot; ah , Wednesday ,
&quot; ahm it looks like I am pretty much booked for , &quot; ah the whole entire day from nine $ A- $ M to , four thirty , $ P- $ M ,
&quot; ahm how is the , week after look .
are you free on &quot; ah perhaps Wednesday ?
no unfortunately I am out of town from Monday through Wednesday ,
so &quot; ahm any of those days will not work ,
and , the following week ,
Thursday and Friday I have a seminar from ten to five ,
so ,
actually the whole of , next week is gone .
&quot; ahm any times are good , next week ?
&quot; ahm let us see &quot; ahm on Monday and Tuesday I have a class from nine to twelve ,
but I seem to be free anytime from there , on afternoon ,
hm I seem to have just the opposite , schedule .
I am , free , &quot; ah in the morning ,
but not in the afternoon , what about , &quot; ahm hm I guess we are going to have to go onto maybe Saturday ?
are you free ?
Saturday , October second ?
&quot; ahm let us see ,
on Saturday &quot; ahm I just have &quot; ah tennis , from &quot; ah eleven to one $ P- $ M ,
but &quot; ahm I guess we should check out Friday , possibly ,
&quot; ahm I just have a meeting from ten , to eleven $ A- $ M ,
and possibly you free anytime , then ?
no Friday I am booked all day , with meetings and classes .
&quot; ahm would you mind working on Saturday ?
&quot; ahm Saturday sounds fine ,
I suppose &quot; ah ,
I guess &quot; ah ,
right after &quot; ahm , I get back from tennis , &quot; ahm &quot; ah I am done by one $ P- $ M ,
&quot; ahm so , I guess we could schedule it anytime after then ,
sounds fine to me .
okay , great .
&quot; ahm let us meet from , two to four .
okay , then it is set .
alright , I guess I will just see you then , good bye .
have a good day .
well it looks like &quot; ah ,
we still have some unfinished work to complete , &quot; ahm it looks like we are going to have to &quot; ah , probably &quot; ah , schedule another meeting &quot; ahm ,
it seems like I guess ,
you can start off by telling me &quot; ah ,
when you are free next week perhaps ?
&quot; ah during the first ,
end of , &quot; ah &quot; ah what is this . the , &quot; ah second last week of November .
okay , &quot; ahm next week is pretty good for me , any morning , &quot; ahm Monday through Wednesday .
Thursday Friday , and Saturday , I will be out of town though .
so &quot; ah Monday Tuesday and Wednesday before two or three would be fine .
&quot; ahm let me see ,
let me , take a look here , &quot; ahm it seems like , &quot; ahm my mornings are pretty much filled up until noon ,
&quot; ahm I guess &quot; ah if we eight need to meet for two hours &quot; ahm it seems like that will not work too well because I have meetings , &quot; ah from one thirty $ P- $ M ?
on Monday and Wednesday ?
&quot; ahm Monday and Tuesday sort of looks bad too ,
&quot; ahm on Monday I am only free from noon to three ,
and on Tuesday , &quot; ahm I have a meeting until noon ,
so that only leaves an hour there .
&quot; ahm if we look at the rest of the week ,
looks like perhaps , &quot; ah Thursday afternoon ?
after , or , no actually Thursday .
&quot; ah you free anytime Thursday then ? in the afternoon ?
no ,
Thursday afternoon is really bad , &quot; ah Friday is really bad too ,
I have &quot; ahm things going on all day ,
what about Wednesday morning before one ,
wow ,
&quot; ahm it seems like &quot; ah , Wednesday morning is bad for me , as well ,
it looks like it might just have to &quot; ah , go to the weekend here , unfortunately ,
&quot; ahm you are out of town on Saturday the twenty seventh ? you said ?
that is right ,
I am , out of town , Thursday through Saturday ,
&quot; ahm do you think perhaps we could meet , Saturday , December fourth ?
I have a lunch meeting from twelve to two , but any other time would be fine .
&quot; ahm Saturday the fourth would not be too bad , and &quot; ah ,
neither would &quot; ah , Sunday ,
the twenty eighth , &quot; ah sometime in the afternoon ,
but if &quot; ahm Saturday seems to be most convenient , then &quot; ah , that it is ,
okay then , &quot; ah I think Saturday from three to five would be perfect .
how is that for you .
sounds fine to me , okay , until then , see you later .
okay ,
so I guess we have to , get together again sometime over the next two weeks .
&quot; ah random starting point ,
&quot; ah Monday or Tuesday of the next two weeks ,
sometime after noon ?
well on Monday ,
the twenty seventh ,
I am afraid all I have open is , the morning , anytime before one o &apos;clock .
&quot; ahm on the twenty eighth I have from ten to twelve , that is my only two times those days .
how about Wednesday for you ?
&quot; ah Wednesday the twenty ninth is , full up for me . &quot; ah how about the next Wednesday , October sixth ?
I will be out of town on the &quot; ah fourth , fifth , and sixth of October .
I do have some time Thursday afternoon ,
the thirtieth .
how about that day ,
you have anything then ?
I have got time after two $ P- $ M .
okay , this is looking interesting , &quot; ah Thursday afternoon , thirtieth is also full for me .
&quot; ah let us just , keep on going .
how does , Friday look ? I am , only booked ten to eleven $ A- $ M .
I am booked pretty solid on Friday .
I have got meetings that start at nine , and pretty much tied up all day until after five .
&quot; ahm first week of October does not look too good either .
I am out of town , as I said , fourth ,
fifth , and sixth and the seventh and eight I have got seminars from ten to five .
we may have to go to the weekend .
okay , how would , Saturday , October second be , I am only booked eleven to one $ P- $ M .
Saturday or Sunday afternoon would be pretty good for me . Saturday I have a brunch meeting that ends at one ,
and Sunday I have lunch meeting that ends at two .
so , either day &quot; ah after those times would be fine for me .
what do you prefer .
okay , how about Saturday , two to four $ P- $ M ?
okay , Saturday it is , that is October second , and I will see you then at &quot; ah two $ P- $ M .
okay , I guess we are done .
okay ,
I guess we have to get together again , two hours next couple of weeks . &quot; ah my schedule is looking pretty messy , you ,
have any particular open slots ?
well ,
Monday and Tuesday of next week are not too bad for me , that is the &quot; ah twenty second and twenty third of November .
I have got the morning free on both of those days ,
how about you ?
&quot; ahm my mornings , are somewhat fragmented . &quot; ah afternoon of the twenty third have any free space for you ?
I am free after three .
no I am afraid the twenty third is all booked up for me in the afternoon .
&quot; ahm I have got the twenty fourth open , &quot; ah all morning up until three o &apos;clock , how about that .
hm best I could do on the twenty fourth , would be from three thirty to five thirty .
that will be a little outside the hours ,
if that is okay with you we could do that ,
or we could keep on going .
&quot; ah Thursday the twenty fifth I have a slot from twelve , to two $ P- $ M if that works .
I am afraid on that Wednesday I have got a meeting that starts at three o &apos;clock ,
and I do not know how late that will run . &quot; ah also the , twenty fifth they are starting on Thursday I will be out of town ,
and I will not be back until Sunday the twenty eighth .
so that kicks us into the next week because of my traveling schedule .
&quot; ahm what does Monday the twenty ninth look like for you ?
okay , the morning is , full for me .
I am free from twelve to three .
well I am booked from one o &apos;clock on ,
all I have got is the morning , I have got , &quot; ah Tuesday morning the thirtieth as well .
we are not having much luck here are we ?
yup , sure seems to be the case at the moment . &quot; ah moving on , how about Tuesday the thirtieth , afternoon ?
I barely have a half an hour &apos;s breathing space on that day . let us go to Wednesday the first .
no , let us skip Wednesday the first , unless you can do it in the morning .
nope I have got class in the morning there , and the afternoon is pretty fragmented as well .
&quot; ah Thursday the second , afternoon ?
okay , the only time restrictions I have there are November the twenty eight from nine to eleven $ A- $ M .
&quot; ah random choice , how about , November twenty eighth , two to four $ P- $ M .
two to four on that Sunday would be fine with me ,
although ,
if you mind working on a Sunday we could make it for an evening .
it is really up to you .
I am pretty much free after six o &apos;clock on the days that I am in town , which of those would you prefer .
&quot; ahm I do not really have any , strong preferences whatever , works with you works with me .
okay fine .
let us leave it on the twenty eighth then , that is &quot; ah November twenty eighth , that is Sunday at two $ P- $ M .
I will see you then .
okay , see you there .
&quot; ahm hello then ?
okay &quot; ahm let us see &quot; ah we got to work this thing out &quot; ahm what time next week , well in the next two weeks ,
is good for you .
well , the seventeenth , is the day that is completely free for me , so how are you set up for the seventeenth ,
&quot; ah God that is terrible ,
I have got something from nine to four thirty ,
it is a seminar ,
&quot; ah it is awful for me , sorry ,
forget the seventeenth ,
that will not work ,
okay ,
&quot; ahm let us see how about , the tenth ,
tell me what you got on the tenth ,
and we will see what we can do with that .
&quot; ahm the tenth is not much better , I am out of town , sorry ,
alright , let us see , &quot; ahm ninth or sixteenth , see what you can , dem zweiten do with that ,
&quot; ah ninth , I am out of town too , sorry ,
well the sixteenth then , what is on the sixteenth , or the eleventh , or the eighteenth ,
&quot; ahm let us see , on the sixteenth , I have , class from nine to twelve .
that means from , twelve to five I am free .
how does that sound .
I have exactly the same schedule on the sixteenth .
classes from nine to twelve .
so ,
twelve until five ,
looks like we need to meet for at least two hours so ,
how about from ,
say ,
one to three . does that sound reasonable ?
yeah , sounds fine , alright , I think that has done it , okay , good ,
alright , so ,
it is , sixteenth , one to three ,
that is confirmed ? thanks , nice doing business with you ,
yeah ,
okay Ben you remember the deal last month ?
well , we have to schedule another meeting .
is not that great .
alright , &quot; ahm let us see .
it is the twenty sixth today ,
how does next week look . &quot; ah for you ,
&quot; ah thirty first would be the best , ideal for me .
how does that sound .
&quot; ahm let us see , &quot; ahm meeting nine thirty to eleven ,
meeting twelve to , two ,
meeting three to four ,
sorry ,
I bet the seventh is out then , as well , but , we will see .
just a sec , sixth seventh and eighth I will be out of town , again ,
you are right ,
that is out .
&quot; ah how about the ninth .
well , is the ninth kosher ? yep , ninth is perfect .
I have nothing scheduled today .
so , name a time .
&quot; ahm something before noon ,
&quot; ahm I have got a meeting on the ninth , from three to four $ P- $ M ,
&quot; ah so anything , from , basically nine to two thirty or so is fine .
what specific time do you like .
nine to eleven will be perfect for me , does that sound fine ?
nine to eleven ?
how about ten to twelve .
ten to twelve is a little better for me because when I , get at nine ,
I have to get all my stuff together ,
get organized , and , all that .
I hope you do not mind if I push it back an hour or so .
what was that time again ?
&quot; ahm ten to twelve ?
see you later ,
Cindy .
I was wondering if we could meet again , in the next couple of weeks ,
there is a couple of more things that I would like to talk about .
sure , I have got some time , free , &quot; ah Tuesday afternoon , that is March ninth , how about then ,
&quot; ahm actually , next Tuesday through Thursday , from the ninth , to the eleventh , I am going to be out of town ,
&quot; ahm so that is not too good , but , either , Monday , around lunchtime , or after two ?
or sometime Friday , would you be free ,
well I do have some time free around lunch , on , Monday March , fifteenth ,
&quot; ah I could do from , &quot; ah twelve to two , something like that ?
hm actually , next Monday is , not that good for me ,
but , Tuesday ,
anytime except nine to twelve ,
would be good ,
&quot; ahm how is that for you ,
alright , I have Tuesday afternoon free , &quot; ahm we are looking at March sixteenth , how about at , &quot; ah one $ P- $ M ?
great , yeah , that sounds good , so we can meet at one , for a , couple hours , on , Tuesday .
okay , thanks .
I will see you then ,
Cindy ,
I was wondering if we could meet for another , couple of hours , sometime in the next couple of weeks ,
&quot; ahm when would be a good day for you ,
well I have Monday morning free , &quot; ah I am free up until three o &apos;clock on that day , how does that look ,
&quot; ah Monday is , not a good day ,
I have got a , a couple of classes , through the day ,
if fact , &quot; ah Monday Tuesday and Wednesday , are not that good ,
how about , Thursday , April first .
&quot; ahm anytime after lunch ,
I am afraid I have got meetings , and a seminar , &quot; ah Thursday and Friday ,
I can meet , maybe at , three o &apos;clock , on Friday ,
how would that ? be .
hm Friday is actually a bad day for me , I have got a meeting from , three until four ,
&quot; ahm well there is always the following week , I am actually out of town , from the sixth , through the , seventh ,
but , either Monday , or , Thursday or Friday ? sometime ? could we meet ,
well I am afraid Monday is all booked up for me , &quot; ah if you are going to be , out of town ,
Thursday ? or only Tuesday and Wednesday ,
&quot; ahm Tuesday and Wednesday only . so Thursday ,
anytime again , after , about eleven $ A- $ M ,
and , Friday , I have got a meeting from three to four ,
and otherwise , that day is empty too ,
okay , Thursday afternoon is open for me , &quot; ah shall we try for about , two $ P- $ M ?
two $ P- $ M should be fine , so , Thursday the eighth .
great ,
okay , Thursday , April eighth it is . bye ,
Cindy . can we meet sometime , next week , or the week after , &quot; ahm for at least two hours ?
okay , sure .
what day did you have in mind .
well , let us see .
&quot; ahm Tuesday , is , not a good time for me .
Monday anytime except , &quot; ah around , two to three , or else , Wednesday ?
&quot; ahm other than , around ten , in the morning . I am free , either those two days ,
I am afraid I have got , meetings , pretty much all day on Monday ,
and , &quot; ah Wednesday ,
Thursday , and Friday , I am going to be out of town ,
I will have to go into the next week .
that is the first week of February .
unfortunately , that is , my turn to be out of town ,
at least for the first couple of days ,
but &quot; ahm let us see ,
Wednesday afternoon ,
or ,
hm Thursday and Friday are not very good days either ,
how about Wednesday afternoon ,
are you free then ?
I could make it Wednesday afternoon , at about three o &apos;clock , how is that for you ,
three o &apos;clock is fine , so &quot; ahm , that is February third , right ?
Wednesday . great , I will see you then ,
okay , Wednesday the third it is . I will see you then ,
I would like to get together again sometime , in the next , &quot; ah couple of weeks ,
do you have any time open on , &quot; ah Monday , the , twenty fourth ?
twenty fourth of May ,
&quot; ahm yeah I have a meeting in the afternoon ,
so the morning is , pretty well empty , &quot; ahm or , Tuesday as well ,
until , around lunch , I am free ,
actually ,
&quot; ahm surprisingly ,
I have got , just a series , of seminars ,
that fill the rest of this week , &quot; ahm so Wednesday through Friday are not going to work , &quot; ahm there is always next Monday ,
I have got a class , in the afternoon , but , the mornings are free , and in fact the next day ,
June the first , I have got a completely free day , are either of those workable for you ,
no actually the &quot; ahm , thirty first , and , June , first and second , I will be out of town ,
I have got Thursday ,
the third , free , in the afternoon ,
or Friday , is pretty free , in the morning .
how about that .
well , it looks like our only choice is going to to be Thursday ,
&quot; ahm I am in a meeting until ten ,
and then I have got the rest of the day free right now , &quot; ahm so do you want to say early afternoon ?
around one ?
okay .
Thursday afternoon around , &quot; ah one o &apos;clock , on June third will work for me .
why do not we make it then .
sounds good , I will , mark it on my calendar .
okay , it is set .
see you then ,
, Cindy , there is a , couple more things I would like discuss with you .
&quot; ahm can we get together for a couple hours , &quot; ahm this week or next ?
okay , sure .
what days did you have in mind .
well ,
&quot; ahm next week ,
Monday ,
anytime after lunch ,
and , Tuesday morning , Tuesday or , Wednesday morning are free as well ,
I am afraid I have got seminars , both Monday and Tuesday , and , &quot; ah meetings Wednesday morning ,
I am free Wednesday afternoon after two ,
how about then .
no , Wednesday &quot; ah , afternoon is no good for me ,
&quot; ahm well there is the next day ,
Thursday the twenty ninth ? anytime after lunch .
otherwise , we would have to go into August . because I am out of town , I come back on the fourth .
&quot; ahm so can you make it on , the twenty ninth ?
the twenty ninth the only time I am free would be early in the morning .
and &quot; ah , if we go into , August ,
then ,
did you say you were back into town on Tuesday ?
no , I do not get back until Wednesday .
&quot; ahm and I have got a meeting , from eleven until one , on Wednesday . the rest of the day is free .
okay , I have got time , Wednesday afternoon after two , or , I could do it Thursday morning .
which day would be better for you .
yeah , Thursday is , not a good day for me , so probably Wednesday .
&quot; ahm you say you have got a meeting until two ,
why do not we set it for about two thirty , &quot; ahm Wednesday August the fourth then .
okay .
Wednesday August fourth at two thirty will work for me .
I will see you then .
good , I will see you then .
well now that we are done doing this , why do not we have a &quot; ah discussion about when we can meet next time .
okay ,
&quot; ahm I am available all day Friday ,
all day Monday , and &quot; ahm ,
let us see ,
in the afternoon of Wednesday the twenty eighth ,
morning of Thursday ,
the twenty ninth ,
afternoon of Tuesday the third ,
afternoon of Wednesday the fourth , and in the morning of , Thursday the fifth .
and Friday that week I am out of town .
well obviously our &quot; ah schedules have been set so it is going to difficult to find meeting time .
I think &quot; ahm is Monday the twenty sixth of July possible ?
I have a ten to twelve meeting .
no actually , that is going to be bad because I have seminar from nine to four thirty .
&quot; ahm and I also have seminar from nine to four thirty , the following day ,
so ,
let us see &quot; ahm how many seconds .
okay Andrew ,
&quot; ahm why do not you tell me which days you are have almost no time .
not the thirtieth ,
second , and third ,
I am out of town . so there is no way I can meet those three days .
okay ,
&quot; ahm on the twenty seventh , I am gone pretty much all day at a seminar .
on the twenty eighth I have nine to eleven meeting , and twelve to one lunch meeting .
on the twenty ninth I have a one to four meeting .
on the fourth I have a nine to eleven meeting .
and on the fifth , I have a two to four meeting .
what about the afternoon of August the fourth ?
I have a meeting from eleven to one . but nothing the rest of that day .
sounds good .
why do not we meet at , two o &apos;clock , &quot; ahm on Wednesday August the fourth then .
okay , let us do that .
alright Andrew , let us set up a meeting within the next week , including the weekend . and the week after that .
let us see , &quot; ahm on the twenty seventh , I have a meeting from one to four .
and on the twenty eighth I have a lunch meeting from twelve to two , and a meeting from three to five .
would either of those days work for you ?
no ,
those days will not work ,
I have a class in the morning ,
as well as same times on Monday and Tuesday the next week .
&quot; ahm maybe we should get together again ,
to &quot; ah talk about some more detail matters , regarding , analysis of the , scheduling experiment .
&quot; ahm how about , &quot; ah sometime during , the second week of April , maybe the week of the ,
&quot; ah what is that . the week of ninth ?
what do you think ,
sure .
the ninth ,
the week of the ninth looks good ,
actually , the ninth , for me , is open all day ,
and , Wednesday the seventh is open all day , &quot; ahm ,
the rest of the week is kind of a mixture of meetings .
does Wednesday the seventh or Friday the ninth look good for you ?
Friday the ninth sounds like a lucky day . &quot; ahm yeah . let us shoot for Friday the ninth ,
how about sometime in the morning ,
after nine ,
&quot; ahm say nine , nine thirty ,
ten o &apos;clock , what not , what do you think .
I cannot believe we got this on the first try . this is good . okay &quot; ahm ,
yeah , Friday morning ,
how about ,
let us say ten o &apos;clock .
that way if I happen to get in a bit little late ,
I will not ,
you know ,
mess up our time ,
so how about &quot; ah ten to twelve , on Friday ?
and &quot; ah I suppose you know how to reach me and everything in case that does not work out ,
but , ten to twelve , looks good .
excellent . so we will go , between ten to twelve ?
and &quot; ahm who is bringing the donuts , this time .
well , they say ladies first , but in this case I will let you do it .
alright , I will bring the donuts , and &quot; ahm you bring something to drink .
maybe some coffee . or maybe some coca cola . something ,
I do no know .
it has got to be like a joint thing .
you know ?
okay , I will do it , I will bring something , I will see you then , bye ,
okay , bye ,
hi Ann , this is &quot; ah Hans ,
&quot; ah it looks like we are going to have to meet again in the next &quot; ah couple of weeks ,
let us see what your schedule is like starting from the twenty sixth ,
&quot; ah let me , first mention that ,
I have a meeting on the twenty sixth , from ten to twelve ,
and on the twenty seventh I have a meeting after three . besides that I am free .
okay ,
actually it turns out that I have seminars all day ,
both those days , so neither one of those , are possible for me ,
&quot; ahm but let us see .
Wednesday , I am available , after one , and , Thursday , I am available , until one .
are either of those days , okay for you ,
hm no those days are not good at all .
&quot; ah we completely &quot; ah , &quot; ah conflict , on those &quot; ah times .
&quot; ah and unfortunately , from the thirtieth , until , the third , including the third , I am going to be out of town .
so the earliest , then we can meet would be the following Wednesday ,
the fourth , of August ,
and , &quot; ah I am free all day except from between eleven and one .
&quot; ah on Thursday , I cannot meet , no I can meet , &quot; ah after one .
okay .
it sounds like we might finally have , a match here .
&quot; ahm on the fourth , we could meet at , one o &apos;clock . that looks good for me , how about for you .
hey , sounds great , &quot; ah &quot; ah one o &apos;clock it is .
I will see you then ,
hi Ann ,
&quot; ah I think it would be a good idea if we meet in the , next couple weeks ,
and I would like to know what your schedule is ,
so we can set up a two hour meeting . how would you feel about that .
okay . okay .
&quot; ah yes . I would like to meet ,
and , it turns out that ,
&quot; ah next week , I have some time ,
but the following week ,
I am completely , &quot; ah unable to meet for two hours .
okay ,
let us see what is , &quot; ah good next week ,
&quot; ah &quot; ah the first &quot; ah two days twenty seventh and twenty eighth ,
I am , busy until twelve o &apos;clock but free anytime after ,
on the twenty ninth , &quot; ah I am extremely busy , and cannot make it ,
and on the thirtieth , I can , make it , between twelve and two thirty .
okay , &quot; ah could you repeat what you said about , &quot; ah this week , the twenty eighth , Tuesday ,
okay , well , the twenty eighth actually sounds good then .
I think we can meet from , oh oh nope , I am wrong .
you are free , after twelve , hm okay .
let us see .
let us look at , Thursday again .
what was your Thursday like ?
okay ,
Thursday does not look too good ,
Thursday I have , &quot; ah a seminar from nine $ A- $ M to four thirty $ P- $ M ,
&quot; ah it looks like Tuesday you can not do it ,
so the only other two days that week are , Monday ,
&quot; ah well actually three days sorry ,
I am free after twelve on Monday ,
Friday , I am free from twelve to two thirty ,
sorry ,
Thursday , I am free from twelve to two thirty , and then Friday ,
I am free all day , except from between ten and eleven , $ A- $ M .
okay .
I think ,
&quot; ah Friday ,
&quot; ah let us see .
I am only free , from , eleven to twelve thirty ,
hm Friday does not sound like it is going to work .
and the entire next week ,
during the week ,
I am busy ,
so , looks like we might have to go to the weekend .
&quot; ahm how are your , Saturday and Sunday looking .
&quot; ah both are pretty good ,
shall we aim for , &quot; ah Saturday nine o &apos;clock , in the morning then ? and we will get it over with , early eleven o &apos;clock .
okay ,
that is not going to work ,
&quot; ah Saturday I am busy until one ,
but from one on I am free .
how about that ,
one o &apos;clock it is , &quot; ah Saturday .
sounds good , see you later ,
okay , see you then .
hi Ann ,
it looks like , &quot; ah we need to meet again , for , &quot; ah a couple hours , &quot; ah the next couple , weeks ,
&quot; ah starting from the twenty second ,
&quot; ah let us see how our schedules are , for the following weeks ,
okay ?
&quot; ah let me , start off by saying right away , that ,
I am not going to be able to make it the first three , days ,
&quot; ah on the twenty fifth , I am free between twelve , and , two ,
and the twenty sixth , I am free the whole time ,
except from between twelve , to , one thirty .
okay ,
it looks like we are going to have a little trouble this time ,
because , I can not meet , &quot; ah either the twenty fifth , or the twenty sixth .
so ,
how are you looking , at the beginning of the following week .
starting the twenty ninth .
&quot; ah twenty ninth does not look too bad ,
well , it does look pretty bad , but I am free between twelve and three , on the twenty ninth ,
on the thirtieth , I have a meeting ,
ten until twelve , but I am free the , rest of the time .
how are those two days .
how are those two days for you .
okay ,
&quot; ah neither one of those is going to work out for me , so , it looks like we will have to go on to Wednesday ,
&quot; ahm Wednesday I am free , until one ,
and , that is all .
how about you ,
&quot; ah Wednesday ,
I guess , is , not going to work out , &quot; ahm I ,
have a class from nine to twelve ,
and then I have a class from one thirty to , &quot; ah three thirty ,
after three thirty on Wednesday I am free , on Thursday , &quot; ah I am free after twelve ,
and Friday is impossible ,
okay ,
it looks like we are back to meet , &quot; ah weekends ,
again , &quot; ah let us see , first day that I could do it ,
is , Sunday the twenty eighth .
how is that for you ,
boy you are taking up all my weekends you know ,
&quot; ah twenty eighth I have a make up lab , from nine to eleven $ A- $ M ,
but after eleven , I am &quot; ah free pretty much ,
sounds like we have got it then , &quot; ah Sunday the twenty eighth at , eleven will be good .
okay ?
okay ,
hi Arthur ,
before we go ,
I think we should schedule a meeting sometime in the next two weeks ,
for at least two hours .
okay ?
sounds good .
&quot; ahm let us see , on , Monday I have something from one to four , can you meet in the morning .
by Monday ,
I assume you mean Monday the twenty seventh ,
I have class from nine to twelve ,
so , let us , jump to , Tuesday the twenty eighth .
in fact ,
I will tell you what ,
، &quot; ah Monday , and Tuesday ,
in fact , Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday of that week ,
nine to twelve ,
&quot; ah I am out . so , &quot; ahm where do you stand on that ,
let us see , &quot; ahm that means that , Wednesday is probably the best for me . I have something ten to noon .
and then , after that , anytime .
how are you for that .
&quot; ah I think I am severely overworked ,
especially on Wednesday ,
because I am booked from nine to four thirty , and , I really want to do this between nine to five .
&quot; ahm I think that the conclusion is ,
that week is out . &quot; ahm let us approach this from a different angle ,
let us start , backwards .
&quot; ah Friday the eighth of October ,
&quot; ahm I seem to only have &quot; ah one hour ,
eleven thirty to twelve thirty taken up ,
&quot; ah we have to , fit it in there if possible .
well if you have eleven thirty to twelve thirty filled up there ,
I have something from ten to five ,
but , we can meet from , eight to ten if you do not mind it that early .
then &quot; ah let us plan it for then on the eighth .
eight to ten .
okay ,
so we will say Friday the eighth ,
eight to ten ,
&quot; ah let us make it a brunch , meeting , &quot; ah at Denny &apos;s .
okay ,
Friday the October eighth ,
eight to ten ,
and we will , eat somewhere .
sounds good ,
we will &quot; ah finalize on those at some other point ,
and that is good .
thanks .
&quot; ah before we go , &quot; ahm it is important , that we meet , &quot; ah sometime in the next two weeks ,
for at least two hours .
&quot; ahm alright ?
alright , that sounds good .
&quot; ahm let us see ,
the biggest thing ,
I am out of town from the twenty fifth through the twenty seventh . &quot; ahm looks like meetings in the afternoon on the three days before that ,
the twenty second through the twenty fourth .
how are you in the mornings ?
&quot; ah well , if we could meet from eight until ten , I can see you on Tuesday the twenty third .
does that sound alright ?
we could wrap this up right now .
&quot; ahm I would do that but , &quot; ah I have some , other , appointments that morning .
&quot; ahm let us see , how about on the second week starting with the twenty ninth .
how about on the the morning of the twenty ninth , or at three $ P- $ M that day .
would not you know .
I am booked .
&quot; ahm I am looking at my schedule here , and it is deceivingly filled up . &quot; ah how about Thursday the second ?
anything in the afternoon ?
free for you ?
okay .
I can meet you at two , but you are going to have to meet me at the little league park .
my kid is playing , a game , so I will see you then .
on the fourth okay ?
well ,
wait ,
I know that can be a problem .
I know how that goes .
&quot; ahm actually I see on the twenty third ,
you mentioned in the morning .
&quot; ahm I can actually move that appointment .
that would probably be better for me , and that would that would get this over with a lot sooner .
so , how about we do that , I think you said , eight to ten ?
okay .
the twenty third .
eight to ten .
right here .
see you then .
okay , that sounds good .
thanks a lot for all that trouble .
boy , it is hard to get our schedules to match but , that will do it . thanks .
yeah .
&quot; ah I am pretty , busy ,
&quot; ahm looks like the only time I have free is possibly , these are all in the afternoons .
it would be &quot; ah like ,
the eighth , the sixteenth , or the nineteenth , in the afternoon .
&quot; ah sixteenth is good in the afternoon , say around one ,
that would work fine , one o &apos;clock on the sixteenth .
alright , so , how does , Monday the twenty ninth . after , three o &apos;clock sound .
&quot; ah I got a meeting from three to four thirty ,
&quot; ahm Tuesday I am free in the afternoon , and Wednesday , I am free all day .
yeah I am pretty much , booked up on Tuesday and Wednesday , how does &quot; ah , Thursday , after eleven o &apos;clock sound .
&quot; ah no I am in a , seminar ,
I am booked up that day , but &quot; ah , I guess I am available ,
let us see .
late afternoon on Friday , and &quot; ah , the following Tuesday and Wednesday I am &quot; ahm , pretty free ,
alright &quot; ah ,
Friday , I am busy in the afternoon ,
I am free in the morning though ,
but , Monday , I have free ,
&quot; ah Tuesday and Wednesday I am going to be out of town so , what looks the best I guess ,
is maybe , Thursday ,
the eighth , in the afternoon ?
yeah , like &quot; ah , I do no know , anytime in the afternoon is fine with me on , Thursday the eighth .
so , why do not we meet at noon on Thursday the eighth then .
alright , Thursday the eighth , at noon .
hey &quot; ah I need to meet with you again .
&quot; ah within the next two weeks huh ? let us see . how about next week ?
well &quot; ah what day were you looking at , in general ?
I have Friday totally free .
&quot; ah I am out of town ,
let us see ,
next Wednesday through Friday so &quot; ah through that Monday .
so what about February the second on Tuesday ?
&quot; ah no that is no good because I will be out of town myself .
&quot; ahm how does Wednesday February third sound ?
oops &quot; ah fine , &quot; ah between ten and twelve is good , and between one and three is good .
yeah I have a meeting until twelve , so like between one and two would probably work out the best .
okay , that is good with me .
so that is February the third at two . &quot; ah &quot; ah &quot; ah one o &apos;clock . right ?
&quot; ah &quot; ah I have a meeting from one to two . I am reading my calendar wrong .
&quot; ah how about after two ?
yeah , after two looks fine with me .
alright &quot; ah , after two , Wednesday the third .
is that set ?
sounds great to me .
yeah , &quot; ah when do you want to meet .
well , Monday and , Tuesday morning , look good for me , other than that , I can not really meet ,
&quot; ah mornings are kind of bad ,
looks like I am pretty tied up ,
&quot; ah how about the week after that . I have Thursday and Friday free ,
&quot; ah Thursday sounds pretty good ,
I have a meeting until ten , in the morning ,
but after that I am free , for the rest of the day ,
okay , say &quot; ah , twelve noon on Thursday June the third ,
that will work fine .
yeah &quot; ah , how about &quot; ah , Monday , July twenty six after , twelve o &apos;clock sound ?
&quot; ah I am booked up with a seminar for the twenty sixth twenty seventh and twenty eighth . &quot; ah how about Thursday the twenty ninth ?
I have Friday completely free too .
&quot; ah the Thursday the twenty ninth I , have a meeting from nine to twelve but after twelve o &apos;clock I am free .
I got a meeting from one to four , so &quot; ah what about Friday ? or , sometime the following week ?
okay ,
I am out of town from the thirtieth to the third so ,
hm let me see .
how about Wednesday August fourth ,
after one o &apos;clock ?
that sounds fine with me .
okay , so you want to meet about , I do no know , two o &apos;clock on Wednesday the fourth ?
yeah . &quot; ah two o &apos;clock Wednesday fourth .
Jackie . I would like to set up a meeting , in the next , &quot; ah couple of weeks . &quot; ahm for two hours .
&quot; ah do you have , some time free ?
yeah I do .
I am , pretty busy ,
but I think ,
&quot; ah next week after I , come back &quot; ahm I am going to be out of town ,
from Wednesday the twenty seventh , until Monday , the first .
&quot; ahm possibly Wednesday ? is that okay for you ?
Wednesday the third ?
yes Wednesday the third I have meetings until ,
&quot; ah two o &apos;clock . do you think we could meet from three to five , on Wednesday ?
yeah . that sounds good . &quot; ahm okay , February three , from three to five .
okay that sounds excellent .
do you ,
want me to call you back , &quot; ahm early next week when I get back from town February , &quot; ahm probably on the second just to confirm everything ?
&quot; ah I will be , out of town on the second .
but if you , &quot; ah talk to my secretary , or write me some email . &quot; ah that would be good ,
okay I will send you some email as soon as I get back from town just to make sure everything went okay ,
and I am not having any problems .
&quot; ahm other than that I will see you on Wednesday .
bye ,
Jackie ,
that was a pretty productive meeting ,
but if you do not mind , I would like to , &quot; ah go over , a couple of things , &quot; ahm with you ,
in the next couple of weeks ,
do you have a couple hours off , &quot; ah during the next couple of weeks ?
my mornings are pretty busy ,
but , probably , in the afternoon , early this week , or , only on Thursday next week ,
&quot; ahm what is good for you ,
&quot; ah next week , looks good for me ,
I am , totally free on Tuesday .
if you want to meet Thursday , which is the third ,

&quot; ahm I am busy , &quot; ah Friday through , next Tuesday .
&quot; ah when do you have time .
geez I am really busy , &quot; ahm next week , &quot; ahm maybe , Tuesday ?
&quot; ahm I am not sure if you meant that you were busy through Tuesday ?
or , are you going to be back on Tuesday ? either Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday afternoon .
what do you think .
yeah .
August fourth , probably , &quot; ahm after one would be great for me .
&quot; ahm how many hours did you want to meet for .
&quot; ah two hours should be fine .
so let us say , two o &apos;clock ?
great .
two to four , on , Wednesday , August fourth .
I will see you then ,
okay , Ava we , really should get together sometime .
do you have , any time after two ? on , the eighth ?
well let us see today is , Friday the fifth , do you want to get together in two weeks ?
&quot; ah I think I might have some time , between those hours that you suggested ,
okay , should we say , between , two and four ? on , Monday the eighth ?
between two and four on Monday the eighth sounds really good for me .
&quot; ah &quot; ah John , I am sorry . I already have a meeting between two and four on Monday the eighth .
can we , get another time and date ?
okay , yeah .
let us , try to work something else out ,
I will be out of town , from the ninth through the , eleventh ,
would you have , eleven to one ? on the twelfth ? which is Friday ?
I am free ,
I have , a meeting from eight $ A- $ M , to five $ P- $ M ,
a seminar ,
but I think I have ,
no ,
well as a matter of fact I will not have any time .
I will be available on March the seventeenth , how about that .
that is a Wednesday .
I am , sorry , I have , got a seminar , on March the , seventeenth ,
&quot; ahm would you have , anything on , Tuesday afternoon . the sixteenth .
well I have class , from nine to twelve , on the sixteenth so ,
anytime before nine , and anytime after twelve would be fine .
how about your calendar ,
okay , should we say , from , one $ P- $ M on the sixteenth ?
that sounds good , do you have an agenda for that day ?
no , I am free the whole afternoon , let us , make it then ,
sounds good , I will see you then , okay ?
okay , take care ,
okay ,
since our , last meeting went so well ,
&quot; ahm I was thinking we could do something the week of the , twenty ninth .
would you have anything , from three on ?
on the twenty ninth ? or the thirtieth ?
John ,
I have a meeting , from three to four thirty on the , twenty ninth ,
so , how long do you have after four thirty that we can meet ,
&quot; ah we , we really should not run it past , five , I do not think , do you have , &quot; ah Tuesday , afternoon ? from three on ?
Tuesday afternoon , from three on , would be fine for me ,
okay , great , I am glad it worked out so well , see you then ,
John , I have one question .
are you talking about March the thirtieth ? from three on ?
&quot; ah yeah I was , do you have a , conflict ?
no that is fine for me .
I will see you then , okay ?
okay , bye bye ,
&quot; ah hi Cindy , we need to &quot; ah meet sometime in the next few weeks .
&quot; ah how would &quot; ah Monday morning be for you ?
I am afraid I have got a meeting until lunch time on Monday .
&quot; ahm how about the afternoon ?
no I have got a meeting all afternoon .
&quot; ah Tuesday morning perhaps ?
nope , I am &quot; ah at a seminar &quot; ah through Friday .
&quot; ah how about either Monday morning , or Tuesday anytime during the day .
I am going to be leaving town on the thirty first , and I will not be back until June third .
&quot; ahm I could meet in the afternoon on June third , or on Friday morning that is June fourth .
would any of that time be good for you ?
&quot; ah how about &quot; ah Thursday the third , &quot; ah &quot; ah say &quot; ah two o &apos;clock through four o &apos;clock ?
yeah , that time looks good for me .
that is two o &apos;clock on Thursday June third . so I will &quot; ah see you again then .
Cindy &quot; ah could you &quot; ah make a meeting &quot; ah sometime in the next two weeks ?
perhaps &quot; ah Monday &quot; ah afternoon ?
I am sorry John , I have got a seminar on Monday and Tuesday .
it runs from nine to four thirty so those days look pretty bad . &quot; ah the first opening I have is &quot; ah Wednesday ,
July twenty eighth .
I have got about three o &apos;clock .
how is that ?
Wednesday would have to be in the morning .
otherwise , &quot; ah Thursday afternoon .
I have got just the opposite . Thursday morning is free , but &quot; ah Wednesday morning is booked .
how about Friday morning the thirtieth ?
I am out of town from the thirtieth &quot; ah through the third .
how about &quot; ah Wednesday &quot; ah either &quot; ah before eleven or after one
I have got Wednesday afternoon pretty much free .
I could meet &quot; ah anytime after twelve on Wednesday ,
or I could meet any time Thursday morning .
whichever day is better for you .
why do not we do , Wednesday two o &apos;clock that way I can get lunch . &quot; ahm
okay , that sounds like a good idea . two o &apos;clock it is then .
that is &quot; ah Wednesday , August fourth .
&quot; ah Nils ? hello Nils ? we did not cover all the ground work during our last meeting you know ,
so we have to reschedule this but , my schedule is pretty filled up for the next few days , and the next week or so ,
well , I am going to be out of town , October , four five and six ,
so I would , like to try to find something in September ,
like , &quot; ahm Wednesday the twenty ninth in the afternoon maybe ?
okay .
&quot; ah Nils .
&quot; ahm I am pretty busy on the twenty ninth ,
I have a seminar from nine $ A- $ M to four thirty $ P- $ M .
but we could probably arrange to get together anytime after five ,
maybe have a &quot; ah dinner meeting ,
discuss business .
let me know what you think .
do you think we could make it , Saturday afternoon ?
&quot; ah that , might be impossible . I have tennis from eleven $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M but , perhaps Saturday afternoon ,
like ,
maybe by three or four ,
&quot; ah yeah , actually I am busy , Saturday , until one myself ,
so , anytime after one say , one thirty to , three thirty ?
okay .
&quot; ah that would be fine . we could probably together maybe at Houlihan &apos;s , or the Sports Garden , over in Station Square , and discuss business .
well , Houlihan &apos;s is better for me , because of the location , so &quot; ah , that is what it will be then .
one thirty Houlihan &apos;s .
okay ?
sounds fine to me , I am all up for it ,
let us continue this , sometime next week .
how about , &quot; ah Monday afternoon .
well ,
I would like to ,
but I am going to be on vacation . from Monday , until , two weeks , from then .
so ,
the seventeenth ,
is the , first time possible for me , although I am going to be busy that day ,
what about , &quot; ah Tuesday ,
the eighteenth , in the morning .
is that still okay ?
no , I am busy in the morning .
I have class .
&quot; ahm however , Thursday the twentieth ,
I am , doing nothing , so we can , have all day if you want .
well , I have , the afternoons available , on Wednesday the nineteenth , or Thursday the twentieth .
okay , let us make it , Thursday the twentieth , at , one $ P- $ M .
okay , that sounds good to me , &quot; ahm let us see .
is there any way that I can get a hold of you between now and then , in case , something comes up while I am away ?
well , you can , send me email , at $ J $ O zero $ E ,
alright ,
that sounds good ,
I should have access , while I am away ,
alright ,
I will see you , on , the twentieth then .
bye ,
well let us see if we can resolve this , sometime , this month .
&quot; ahm next week I am actually , or this week , I am available on Friday .
I am going to be on , vacation then ,
I have , time tomorrow ,
but if that is not good for you ,
then the next time for me , would be Monday the seventh , any time ,
well ,
I am out of town , Monday the seventh , eighth , and ninth ,
and , Thursday the tenth , afternoon I am available though .
well I will not be in the tenth , but , on , the eleventh , I , could , meet you any time after twelve ,
okay , I am free all day on the eleventh .
let us make it , two $ P- $ M .
that sounds good , that will give me time to eat , lunch , and , do a little bit of preparation ,
okay , great , see you then ,
alright , see you the eleventh , at two . bye ,
well , let us get together again , &quot; ahm but I am not going to be available , until the twenty first .
you have nothing at all before then ?
I have got tomorrow , and Wednesday available ,
but ,
if not ,
until after the twenty first ,
&quot; ahm what about the afternoon of the twenty second , on Thursday .
well I have got a seminar tomorrow ,
and then I am on vacation ,
I am , out of here .
but , &quot; ah the twenty first is available ,
but you can not make that .
and the twenty second , I have a meeting in the afternoon .
so ,
but the twenty third , I am available in the morning , too .
okay , I could do , Friday morning , on the twenty third , what time would you like to meet ?
how about ten $ A- $ M .
sure , that sounds good to me ,
okay , see you then ,
alright , see you then , bye ,
could we get together again Monday afternoon ?
well I can Monday , the ninth , I am going to be away on vacation next week .
okay , I have got , Monday afternoon , say about one thirty ?
okay ,
that sounds good to me ,
&quot; ah let us see . one thirty , on Monday the ninth ,
&quot; ahm do you want to make a , backup date , for , Tuesday the tenth ,
just in case , do you have time in the morning ?
yep , I am available , &quot; ah just about any time in the morning .
so we can say ten $ P- $ M , just in case , &quot; ah somebody gets stuck somewhere .
that is , ten $ A- $ M ?
yep , ten $ A- $ M ,
okay ,
that is what I thought ,
alright ,
so Monday the ninth , at , one thirty I think you said ,
or ,
Tuesday the tenth , ten $ A- $ M , if ,
we have to .
right . right .
&quot; ahm let us meet in your office .
great , that sounds like a good plan , I will , see you then ,
okay , thanks ,
alright , bye ,
alright , that sounds like a , good idea to me , when do you have available .
well I am out of town , from the ninth , to the eleventh and &quot; ah , Friday is , pretty full ,
but , the eighth , Monday ,
&quot; ahm I am available after two $ P- $ M .
I have got a meeting on Monday ,
that goes from two to four ,
so that , does not look very good for me ,
&quot; ahm what about the following Monday in the morning ,
I have got a meeting at ten $ A- $ M , so that , probably would not do very good .
but &quot; ah , I am available , afternoon , on , Tuesday .

if you want to make it a , short meeting ,
we could get together , twelve thirty to two , otherwise , I am , free after , three o &apos;clock , on Tuesday ,
that might be a bit tight , what about , &quot; ahm Wednesday .
Wednesday is all free for me , so , &quot; ahm if that , would work out for you , that would be perfect ,
well ,
my Wednesday is all , fragmented , with meetings through the day ,
there is no , two hour block of time there ,
&quot; ahm on Thursday , &quot; ah anytime after eleven , would be alright ,
or , on Friday , anytime , before three would be good ,
well , actually , Thursday is not too good for me , &quot; ahm I have got stuff all over the place ,
what about Friday , after two ? thirty or so ?

no it is not , quite well ,
&quot; ahm April fifth is , pretty busy ,
what about , &quot; ah Tuesday the sixth . between &quot; ahm &quot; ah you know ,

alright , I will see you Thursday , the eighth , then , bye ,
so , how about if we get together on Monday ? &quot; ahm anytime , between nine and two , or , after three o &apos;clock ,
Monday is really bad for me , I have things , all over the place , what about , &quot; ah Tuesday , after three ?
well ,
Tuesday I have a seminar that lasts , pretty much all day long ,
&quot; ahm Wednesday , would be alright , after eleven o &apos;clock , for the rest of the day ,
hm that is too bad ,
I am out of town , Wednesday Thursday and Friday ,
I guess we have to ,
&quot; ah I am out of town the following Monday also ,
so we have to look at , &quot; ah Tuesday or after , the following week ,
&quot; ah what about , after three o &apos;clock , on , Tuesday , the , second ?
well on Tuesday , I will also be out of town , &quot; ah on Wednesday , after , twelve o &apos;clock , would be fine ,
okay , that sounds , good for me ,
&quot; ahm I have a meeting from one to two ,
so we could meet , after two o &apos;clock ,
or would Friday , after three , be better for you ,
no I like Wednesday better , so , why do not we make it two o &apos;clock , on Wednesday ,
and , I will see you then ,
alright , I will see you Wednesday the third then , at two o &apos;clock ,
can we get together , Monday ? say , anytime from nine , to one o &apos;clock ?
no , actually , I have a meeting from ten , to twelve .

what about Tuesday after two ? or Wednesday , after , eleven or so .
alright Tuesday , is not going to be good ,
and Wednesday is not good , at those times ,
&quot; ahm Thursday , the whole day is bad ,
Friday the day is full , &quot; ahm the following Monday ,
on the thirty first ,
we could make it , anytime between nine and two ,
&quot; ah that is too bad , because &quot; ah Thursday I was free all day ,
&quot; ahm and Monday Tuesday and Wednesday of the following week , I will be out of town .
so that will not work , how about Thursday , or Friday of the following week .
Thursday I am free , after eleven .
alright , Thursday , &quot; ahm I am busy only until ten , in the morning .
so we could get together , &quot; ah eleven , to one o &apos;clock , that would be alright with me ,
actually let us not make it over lunch , &quot; ah let us have it in the afternoon .
&quot; ahm how does that sound to you .
alright , the end of the day ?
we can make it three to five o &apos;clock ,

next Monday , I could get together with you anytime after , twelve ,
well Wednesday I am free in the morning but not in the afternoon , &quot; ahm how about Thursday ? after twelve o &apos;clock ?
no ,
I have , a meeting from one to four on Thursday ,
what about Friday ,
I have Friday free all day .
I am going to be gone , unfortunately , from Friday , through next Tuesday .
&quot; ah we could try to make it , Wednesday , August fourth , anytime after one o &apos;clock ,
okay , that would work , except I would prefer something , in the morning . what about Thursday morning .
are you &quot; ahm , free Thursday morning ?
Thursday morning , I will be busy , but Friday I am available in the morning , anytime , before two , o &apos;clock ,
no ,
Friday will not work because I will be out of town ,
so let us go with Wednesday , afternoon , what time did you say you wanted again ?
anytime after one , is fine for me , we could make it , as early , or as late as you want ,
okay , let us have it towards the end of the day .
so let us say we meet at three , and go until five , or five thirty .

Larry , &quot; ah let us see , the twenty seventh looks good , that is a Thursday .
how does it look to you ?
Thursday is out for me Red , &quot; ah I am going to be busy all day .
&quot; ah let us see , how does , Monday the thirty first look , before noon .
no , I am sorry I am going to be out of town until Wednesday the third .
&quot; ah let us see , I could squeeze you in in the morning on the twenty eighth .
sorry Red the twenty eighth is out for me .
&quot; ah what day are you leaving town .
I am leaving the thirty first .
okay , &quot; ah so let us try and get this done before the thirty first then .
&quot; ah what does the twenty fifth look like for you , say , between , ten and twelve .
no I am sorry , I am going to be busy between , ten and , two , but I am free after that .
how is that ?
no ,
I am going to be busy between two and four thirty ,
&quot; ah let us see , how about , Monday the twenty fourth ,
at nine o &apos;clock .
I can do it , if it is going to be for two hours ? no I can not .
I could do it after twelve , but , I have a meeting at ten .
not good .
&quot; ah looks like I am not going to be able to do this before you get back .
you said you are going to get back on the third , right ?
yeah , I am available the third , anytime after eleven $ A- $ M ,
and the only meeting I have on the fourth is between three and four $ P- $ M .
okay , &quot; ah how about the third then , &quot; ah let us meet for lunch . we will go between , noon and two .
noon sounds good ,
I could do with a good lunch on Thursday when I get back . okay , &quot; ahm does any place sound good to you ?
yeah , how about meeting me at Gullifty &apos;s for lunch at noon .
sounds good .
Thursday , noon , I will be there .
see you then .
alright Red , pay attention now . &quot; ah we need to set it up again ,
&quot; ah two hours I need to meet with you for , &quot; ah how does the twenty eighth look , &quot; ah sometime before noon .
what did you do ,
schedule two things at once again ? and you tell me I need to pay attention .
well no ,
I am sorry ,
this time I can not bail you out ,
at least not at that time .
I am busy until one .
I am free after that though .
bail me out ? when did I ever ask you to bail me out of anything ?
I make my own problems .
I make my own solutions .
now , let us get back to what is important here , and , &quot; ah let us see when we can meet .
how about , Thursday for lunch , the twenty ninth .
I would rather not ,
I have some time , after lunch on Tuesday the third ,
but , that is about it right now .
no , I have got that seminar that is running , all day both the twenty sixth and twenty seventh .
so they are just out .
&quot; ahm I could meet you at eleven on the twenty ninth , Thursday .
no good Thursday , I am going to busy at a lecture until noon ,
&quot; ah and then I am going to be leaving town on the thirtieth , not getting back until Tuesday .
how does &quot; ah Wednesday the fourth , after one o &apos;clock .
well I am so glad you could make time in your busy schedule .
yeah , Wednesday the fourth after noon would be fine .
mean anytime after noon or , &quot; ah something specific . &quot; ah I am free after one o &apos;clock ,
so ,
how does that look to you between , one and three .
one and three is good .
&quot; ah let us say , Siam kitchen like we had lunch a couple weeks ago . that sound good ?
yeah , you get to pay this time since &quot; ah that insult at the beginning of this here .
well , perhaps we should meet at your office , then , sir .
&quot; ah I can be there at one o &apos;clock , thank you .
no ,
do not come to my office ,
&quot; ah I do not want you to see what I have got for a secretary ,
I will never live it down . Siam Kitchen sounds best .
fine . I will meet you there at one o &apos;clock .
Gerald , &quot; ahm let us see .
we should meet between , &quot; ah nine $ A- $ M and five $ P- $ M I guess , &quot; ahm sometime in the next couple of weeks ,
&quot; ah when are you free ,
I have got a class , on &quot; ah , Tuesday and Thursday from nine to twelve . and &quot; ah got a , meeting on both Mondays .
and , &quot; ah also ,
&quot; ah &quot; ah yeah the meeting is from two to four , and also a seminar on Fridays from eight to five ,
so Friday is pretty much out .
I will give you my schedule .
I have a meeting from , ten to twelve on Monday ,
&quot; ahm the fifteen , and from one to four thirty Monday the fifteenth , on Monday the eighth I have a meeting from nine to eleven ,
&quot; ah twelve to two , I will be out of town from the ninth through the eleventh ,
on the twelfth I have class from nine to eleven , a meeting from , one to three , from four to five ,
&quot; ahm Wednesday the seventeenth ,
I have a seminar from nine to four thirty so that is out for me ,
Thursday the eighteenth ,
class from nine to twelve , meetings from one to three , four to four thirty ,
Friday the nineteenth ,
meetings from ten to eleven , twelve thirty to two .
that is quite a bit .
why do not we ,
&quot; ah let us see . looks like Monday afternoon on the fifteenth is going to be out ,
how about Monday on the eighth .
what is your schedule that day .
Monday the eighth , I am free after two .
okay , well , then that is pretty much out .
&quot; ah Tuesday I think you said you had class from nine to eleven and , &quot; ah twelve to two ?
is that right ? and , is that , &quot; ah for both Tuesdays ?
I will be out of town Tuesday the ninth , &quot; ahm Tuesday the sixteenth , I have class , from nine to twelve .
I am free after twelve ,
that sounds good then ,
&quot; ah Tuesday the sixteenth I got class from nine to twelve ,
but after that , &quot; ah looks like we , we can meet anytime , between twelve to five ,
what would you prefer ,
let us meet right at twelve , and &quot; ah have lunch , so , maybe twelve to two ,
okay , sounds great .
see you then ,
hey Gerald ,
why do not we meet , &quot; ahm either Thursday the first ,
or Thursday the eighth , sometime after , eleven $ A- $ M .
&quot; ah Thursday the eighth is , &quot; ah pretty good for me .
&quot; ah anytime after eleven would be fine , &quot; ah maybe &quot; ah , twelve o &apos;clock to two , on the eighth ?
&quot; ah twelve o &apos;clock to two would be fine . why do not we meet then ,
okay .
see you then .
hi Gerald ,
&quot; ahm I have next Friday the twenty ninth totally free ,
and &quot; ahm , Wednesday the third ,
I am free after twelve .
are you free on one of these days ?
well I am going to be out of town , from the twenty seventh to the &quot; ah twenty ninth .
so , I am not going to be able to meet then ,
but on the third , &quot; ah I got a meeting from one to two ,
but we could meet anytime between two and five .
I am free anytime , &quot; ah on the third , after twelve . so , &quot; ah maybe two or three o &apos;clock ?
which is better for you ,
yeah , three o &apos;clock is fine .
so we can meet , &quot; ah from three to five .
okay , I will see you at three o &apos;clock , on , February third .
I would like to arrange for us to meet again in the next &quot; ah couple of weeks .
Monday afternoon of the eighth looks good to me .
I could meet from twelve until two on Monday afternoon .
well , I have a lunch meeting at twelve so I will not be available until the afternoon .
I will have to &quot; ah look at the next week after that .
I will be out of town so I have to look at the next week .
I am sorry .
actually , if we could meet for lunch on Friday the twelfth I could just barely squeeze that in .
well ,
I have a seminar on Friday the twelfth that goes all day . same thing on the following week on the nineteenth .
but aside from that on the week of the fifteenth to the nineteenth , I have Monday morning free ,
&quot; ahm Tuesday afternoon is free , and Wednesday all day .
Tuesday afternoon looks good to me any particular time good for you ?
well , how about one o &apos;clock ? that will give me time to get back from lunch .
that is good .
that is it then , one o &apos;clock Tuesday the sixteenth of March
great .
I will see you then .
for our next meeting , &quot; ahm I , wonder whether , earlier is , better I could fit ,
Monday afternoon March the twenty ninth ,
is the , first I have available ,
I have a meeting , starting at three , but I could meet at , one o &apos;clock ,
does not work for me .
well ,
looking at early April ,
it is only a few days later ,
Thursday the first ,
all afternoon is available for me ,
the first is bad for me ,
I have got , about a half hour in there but that is it ,
&quot; ahm what about Friday afternoon , at , two thirty or three ,
actually three would be better ,
no ,
not for me ,
Friday morning is okay , and , then the following Friday the ninth ,
that the morning is okay ,
could you fit one of those in ?
Friday the ninth would be great , how about ten o &apos;clock in the morning .
okay , Friday April ninth , ten o &apos;clock . it is a deal .
great , I will see you then .
for , our next meeting , &quot; ahm I have got &quot; ah , Monday morning January twenty fifth ,
available or ,
well no Tuesday all day is bad so ,
&quot; ah how is Monday for you ,
Monday is pretty , booked up actually the only time I have ,
next week would be , on Tuesday , starting at three , what about the following week &quot; ahm say ,
Tuesday the second starting at three , or , Wednesday , starting at two or three ,
yes .
&quot; ah Wednesday , February third , two or three whichever you like , &quot; ahm two . let us say two .
well ,
I have a meeting that gets out of two ,
&quot; ahm two thirty would probably be best for me .
if that would be alright with you ,
sure . two thirty then , Wednesday the third .
okay , I will mark it down .
looking at the last week in May ,
I see &quot; ahm , Monday morning the ,
twenty fourth is good for me and , Tuesday morning , but ,
not Wednesday , how about you .
my mornings are pretty busy those days .
what about , Thursday .
&quot; ah no , my Thursday is , booked straight through .
so , we will have to go to my Friday .
&quot; ahm Monday the thirty first , the the morning is good for me ,
well , I will be away from the thirty first , until the second .
so unless you have afternoons , early next week ,
then we will have to go to the following week ,
&quot; ahm either Thursday , afternoon , or Friday morning ,
Thursday afternoon . for sure .
&quot; ahm Thursday , June the third , &quot; ah whatever time you would like , in the afternoon ,
sounds good .
one o &apos;clock then .
great ,
so &quot; ahm ,
I am going to be out of town from end of July , the thirtieth , &quot; ah for a couple days in August .
can we , let us see .
Monday morning twenty sixth of July is good for me . and , the morning of Wednesday is good for me .
and . &quot; ah actually , Monday Tuesday and Wednesday all of the mornings are good for me .
how about you ?
well , I have got seminars on the twenty sixth and twenty seventh that run all day . &quot; ahm from nine to four thirty ,
so that is bad .
and on the twenty eighth I have got a meeting in the morning from nine to eleven .
I have the afternoon free on the twenty eighth .
well ,
my afternoon from two to the end is fixed but if we met say ,
over lunch , eleven thirty , one thirty ,
how is that ?
well unfortunately I already have a lunch meeting scheduled so I would not be able to meet until one o &apos;clock .
&quot; ah what about on the twenty ninth ?
I have got a meeting from one to four but I am free before then .
nope . looks to me like we are looking in August .
&quot; ahm let us see . first thing available is Wednesday afternoon .
Wednesday August fourth .
well that will work for me .
I have a meeting from nine to eleven and I am free after that .
so it is , Wednesday August fourth .
how about &quot; ahm two thirty ?
two thirty sounds great , that will give us the rest of the afternoon .
I will see you then .
right .
&quot; ah hi , I guess we need to &quot; ah set up &quot; ah &quot; ah a scheduled meeting in the next two weeks here .
okay &quot; ahm ,
probably the best time for me would be , next Monday the twenty seventh in the morning ,
or , Wednesday the twenty ninth in the afternoon .
&quot; ahm okay , I am in free in the morning before nine .
&quot; ahm on Monday , and Wednesday &quot; ahm &quot; ah however , Wednesday afternoon , I am &quot; ahm busy until four thirty .
so &quot; ah , if you want to meet past four thirty that is fine .
&quot; ahm let us try for another day .
&quot; ahm how about , Tuesday morning , or , possibly Thursday ,
&quot; ah say , after two o &apos;clock .
&quot; ahm again Tuesday morning is not very good for me , I am busy from nine to twelve .
&quot; ahm let us see . what about , Wednesday on the sixth .
&quot; ah Wednesday the sixth I will be out of town .
I am out of town the fourth , fifth , and sixth .
&quot; ahm let us see ,
and the seventh and eighth I have got seminars from ten to five .
&quot; ah Friday the first ,
see ,
I have got a break from eleven to twelve thirty , and from two to three thirty .
nothing quite big enough though .
how big of a time slot are we looking for here ?
two hours , I believe it was ?
yes , that is about what it will take .
well ,
I am free almost &quot; ah all afternoons except for , Wednesday , and Thursdays .
&quot; ahm are afternoons good for you ? on any of those days ,
except for Wednesdays , and Thursdays .
no , afternoons are not really good for me .
I am , going into four or five o &apos;clock on those days .
&quot; ahm like I said there is the , two to three thirty slot on , Friday the first ,
but that is probably too short for a meeting .
what about during the weekends ? how do your weekends look ?
I am &quot; ah free , Sunday the third , &quot; ahm and on Saturday the second , &quot; ahm anytime before eleven , or after one .
okay , &quot; ah on Saturday the second I have got a meeting until one .
so , after that I am free .
so , that sounds good to me .
&quot; ah so , should we try for , Saturday the second , about one o &apos;clock ?
sounds peachy . let us &quot; ah make it for Saturday at one . your house or mine .
&quot; ah why do not we meet here at the office .
it is probably , the easiest . in between .
but I just got a new hot tub .
okay , we can &quot; ah meet there .
&quot; ah I will bring along scuba gear .
will June be coming as well ? or &quot; ah is she going out with Wally .
&quot; ah no , I do not think so .
&quot; ahm well , I have got to go now .
I will talk to you on , Saturday the second then .
hi , I guess we need to start &quot; ah scheduling a meeting again .
&quot; ah when is free . what is the best times looking for you .
okay , for me it looks like , &quot; ah the mornings of , the next two , Monday , Tuesday or Wednesdays are free .
well , if we want to have a , &quot; ah early Tuesday , &quot; ahm wait , did you say Monday what and Wednesday ?
I am free during the &quot; ah morning for both the next two weeks , on Monday , Tuesday , and Wednesday .
&quot; ah fine , we can meet &quot; ah eight $ A- $ M on Tuesday &quot; ahm on either Tuesday , on the twenty third or thirtieth .
is that amiable for you ?
&quot; ahm let us see ,
is there a possibility that we might be able to meet at , say three o &apos;clock , on Monday the twenty ninth ?
&quot; ah the twenty ninth I have to do some lab work , &quot; ahm from three to five .
&quot; ahm what about Tuesday afternoons , &quot; ahm the twenty third I am free , from three to five and ,
on the thirtieth I am free , after noon .
okay ,
both of those are bad for me , &quot; ahm what about &quot; ah the possibility of Wednesday the twenty fourth ,
&quot; ahm I have got a meeting from three to four maybe &quot; ah if we could meet at four o &apos;clock ?
&quot; ah that would be perfectly acceptable .
&quot; ahm four , on the twenty fourth it is .
okay , I will see you then .
okay , that is &quot; ah , pretty good then .
could we set up a time for meeting , &quot; ah sometime in the next couple weeks then .
sure , how about , Monday morning .
&quot; ah Monday is really not good ,
I have got class from nine to twelve .
and &quot; ah Tuesday is kind of out . same reason in the morning .
&quot; ahm how about , the afternoon on Tuesday .
I am tied up in meetings , all afternoon Tuesday from , twelve to five , &quot; ah maybe ,
Wednesday , afternoon would be good .
&quot; ahm Wednesday really does not work .
&quot; ah I am in a seminar from nine to four thirty .
&quot; ah we will need at least two hours for this meeting .
so &quot; ahm , I got time , let us say , Thursday , between , twelve and two thirty ?
does that work with you ?
&quot; ahm Thursday I have got a meeting from , one to two ,
so ,
if you are free after that ,
I am free .
&quot; ah no go .
I got a meeting from two thirty to five o &apos;clock , on Thursday .
Friday is pretty open though .
I have got a meeting from &quot; ah , ten to eleven but the rest of the day is open .
how about you ?
&quot; ahm Friday is really bad for me unless we could , squeeze it in between , eleven and twelve thirty ,
other than that I am , filled the rest of the day .
I think we are going to need &quot; ah at least two hours , for this meeting .
so &quot; ah ,
let us look on , to the week of the fourth , of October ,
&quot; ahm again I got class , from nine to twelve on Monday and Tuesday ,
but any other time would work okay .
&quot; ahm , that week is , pretty bad for me . the , fourth fifth and sixth I am , vacationing in the Bahamas and ,
that just leaves , Thursday and Friday which ,
I am free , only until , ten o &apos;clock so if we could do it early morning like eight to ten ,
okay , I guess &quot; ah , we are going early morning .
how about Friday , the eighth , &quot; ah eight to ten then ?
works for me , I will , pencil you in Friday , eight to ten .
okay Chris , &quot; ah well , that wraps that up today .
let us set up a meeting for , next week , or maybe the week after .
we are going to need about two hours .
okay ,
how about , Monday morning &quot; ah , anytime in the morning or , in the afternoon up until three o &apos;clock I am free .
&quot; ahm Monday is really shot hm for most of the day .
how about early on Tuesday , I am clear before ten o &apos;clock or after three o &apos;clock .
&quot; ah Tuesday , afternoon is out for me .
I am , in a meeting from , two to four thirty .
I have got , too many meetings this week . &quot; ahm how about , Wednesday , before three .
&quot; ahm no , Wednesday really does not work .
let us shoot for &quot; ah Thursday .
I got class from nine to twelve , and a meeting from two to four .
but if we can &quot; ah , fit in the meeting between twelve and two ,
&quot; ah it would work pretty well .
&quot; ahm Thursday , Friday , and Saturday I am , out of town .
&quot; ah so those days are all out for me , &quot; ah I guess ,
move onto like , maybe sometime the following week , &quot; ah Monday , before , one o &apos;clock ?
is that good for you ?
&quot; ahm Tuesday I have got a meeting from one to three , and , then another meeting from four to six ,
so , that really will not work . &quot; ah how about , see ,
December first , &quot; ahm before one ?
&quot; ahm no .
I only have an hour and a half before one o &apos;clock .
&quot; ahm I guess &quot; ah , Thursday is the next day ,
I got class from nine to twelve and &quot; ah , the rest of the day is open .
how about sometime in the afternoon ?
&quot; ahm the only time I have Thursday is , twelve thirty to , two .
&quot; ah and Friday I am in a conference all day . so , Friday is no good .
&quot; ahm if we could do it in an a hour and a half on Thursday , just , you know , like , rush it
okay ,
seeing how we are out of days , I guess we will have to settle on Thursday for an hour and a half then .
well ,
I guess ,
we really , should make it two hour for this meeting ,
so ,
&quot; ahm guess ,
try on the weekends ,
&quot; ah the , twenty seventh I am out of town , the twenty eighth I am free , all day , if you want to go for a Sunday meeting .
okay , we will go with Sunday the twenty eighth , say &quot; ahm , around noon until two ?
is that okay ?
yeah , hopefully I will be awake by then , that is fine .
okay , I have &quot; ah some time open next week and the following week .
I think meeting sooner would be better so , how is your schedule Monday ?
I have open from two to three in the I am busy from two to three in the afternoon ,
any other time is good for me .
I am afraid my calendar is really booked up for Monday .
&quot; ahm I have got some time , &quot; ahm hm no I am sorry that is really not enough time .
do you want to meet for at least two hours ?
I am sorry I did not hear what you just said could you repeat that ?
yes we need to meet for at least two hours .
okay , in that case I am looking pretty bad for this &quot; ah last week of January .
how about your schedule in the first week of February , what does that look like for you ?
okay on Monday and Tuesday the first and second I will be out of town .
on Thursday I have a seminar all day and I have a seminar all day Friday as well .
the only day that is good for me next week would be Wednesday the third . &quot; ah sometime after twelve .
between twelve and five .
well I do have some time late Wednesday afternoon .
how about &quot; ah three o &apos;clock on February third ?
does that suit you ?
three o &apos;clock on the third would be great for me .
we could &quot; ahm meet until five and I think that will give us enough time to get everything done .
okay , that sounds good .
I will see you then .
okay we need to set up a meeting for at least two hours sometime in the next two weeks either the week beginning the twenty fourth or the week beginning the thirty first .
for the next week the only days I have open are Monday or Tuesday in the morning .
how are those for you ?
&quot; ah the only thing I have open on Monday is &quot; ah the afternoon , or Tuesday the same thing very late afternoon .
how does your &quot; ah schedule look on Wednesday that is May twenty sixth ?
do you have anything in the afternoon open there ?
okay ,
Wednesday Thursday and Friday ,
the twenty sixth ,
twenty seventh , and twenty eighth , I have seminars all day so , maybe we should look to next week .
I have Tuesday the first open all day , as well as the morning of May Monday the thirty first .
well I am afraid I am going to be out of town the thirty first , and also the first and second of June .
I will be back on Thursday .
I have got some time available Thursday afternoon , or Friday morning .
a either of those two days good for you ?
well I am free , the afternoon of Thursday the third .
what would be a good time for you to meet ? any time is good for me , after ten in the morning .
well how about &quot; ah one o &apos;clock on Thursday . &quot; ah would that be okay ?
one o &apos;clock on Thursday would be great .
we could &quot; ah meet until three and if we needed any extra time then we would still have that .
is that good for you ?
yeah , that will work great .
I will see you then .
okay ,
I would like to set up a meeting with you , sometime in the , next two weeks ,
I would like to meet for at least two hours .
why do not we , see , what you have open on Monday , I am &quot; ah free the whole afternoon after twelve .
Monday , and Tuesday , I have got seminars from nine until four thirty in the afternoon so , those two days are pretty gone ,
how about , Wednesday , that is the twenty eighth ?
I have , got time open after two $ P- $ M , how about you .
on Wednesday , I have a meeting that is starting at two and , going into the late afternoon ,
why do not we , look to Thursday .
I have a lecture from nine to twelve but I will be free after that ,
&quot; ah if that does not work then , we will need to look to next week ,
because I am going to be out of town ,
from Friday the thirtieth , until , Tuesday the third .
well on the twenty ninth , I have got meetings up until four o &apos;clock in the afternoon ,
&quot; ahm Friday , and Monday , August second are free ,
for me of course ,
but that does not help ,
&quot; ahm how about , Tuesday the third ?
I have got time , all afternoon is free for me ,
I am afraid I have got meetings , &quot; ah in the morning , up until eleven o &apos;clock ,
that brings us to Thursday ,
I have got , Thursday morning free ,
&quot; ahm anytime before two , actually , how about Thursday .
well Thursday is , not going to to work for me either , except after one o &apos;clock .
why do not we look at Friday I have a meeting from two to four ,
so we could meet at any other time on that day ,
that is Friday the sixth .
no I am afraid I am going to be out of town all day on Friday the sixth ,
you say you do not have anything open , Thursday morning , or Wednesday afternoon ?
yes ,
actually I do have , Wednesday the fourth , open in the afternoon ,
I have a meeting from , eleven to one ,
are you free after one on that day ,
yeah the afternoon is okay , on &quot; ah Wednesday , how about , two $ P- $ M .
will that fit in for you ?
two $ P- $ M on Wednesday the fourth would be great . I will see you then .
okay , good .
thanks for your time .
okay .
I think we ought to schedule another meeting , &quot; ah some time the next couple weeks ,
&quot; ah it is probably going to be about two hours long ,
so ,
I am looking over my schedule , I am out of town on the ninth to the tenth of this next week ,
&quot; ahm and Friday is a little full ,
although there is some possibility , &quot; ahm before lunch or around lunchtime on Friday ?
how does that sound .
I have seminars on Fridays , that run all day .
what about , Thursday , afternoon .
let me see .
I am out of town , Thursday the eleventh ,
and , do not really think ,
I have time to squeeze it in , on the eighteenth ,
and , &quot; ahm I have seminars also on Wednesday the seventeenth ,
but , &quot; ah the sixteenth looks good ,
as far as the afternoon ,
that is Tuesday the sixteenth ? &quot; ahm &quot; ah not much other time than that .
how does Tuesday the sixteenth sound .
sounds fine to me , I get out of class at twelve ,
and , I would like to go take lunch ,
but , anytime , after say one o &apos;clock , would be fine with me ,
okay , let us make it say one thirty , at , &quot; ah on Tuesday the sixteenth .
that sounds good .
do you want to meet in the same place ?
yeah . I think it would be a good idea ,
okay , see you then ,
I think we have some additional &quot; ah issues we ought to address , &quot; ah in another meeting ,
if we could get together sometime , in the next two weeks ,
probably set aside a block of about two hours , how does , &quot; ah Monday the fifth sound .
well I could do it in the morning , except that we need a couple hours and I have a seminar starting at ten ,
so that is probably not so good .
&quot; ahm what about , the morning of the sixth ?
I am out of town , on the , sixth and the seventh . so that is not good .
and , &quot; ah let me see , the eighth , Thursday and Friday , &quot; ahm well they kind of flip flop .
Thursday is good in the afternoons ,
after eleven anyway ,
and Friday is good in the morning .
either , the first and second ,
or the eighth and ninth .
okay .
the eighth and ninth are possible for me ,
I take it , that ,
you are going to be busy , &quot; ah the end of March ,
yes .
the only time I have at the end of March , is , on the thirtieth , around lunchtime .
I have from about eleven , to two . which would give us enough time .
&quot; ahm or , &quot; ahm later in the afternoon , on the twenty ninth . &quot; ah say after two thirty .
the thirty first is pretty hacked up .
okay ,
well , both of those times conflict with , the only two meetings that I have ,
the whole , three days there . so , why do not we look back at the eighth and ninth .
I have a meeting on the eighth , from , nine to ten in the morning , but any other time those two days I am free .
okay ,
&quot; ah let us plan on a lunch meeting then on the eighth ,
say &quot; ah we can start at eleven thirty .
that will give me enough time to , &quot; ah get out of my meeting , and , &quot; ah meet for lunch somewhere .
okay , that sounds good .
is there some way that I can get in touch with you in the meantime ? in case something comes up and we need to switch it to , the ninth ?
&quot; ah sure , &quot; ahm just , &quot; ah leave a message at my office number ,
two four two nine ,
and ,
&quot; ahm &quot; ah I guess we ought to set , &quot; ah &quot; ahm a place to meet also ,
or , do you want to just do that , &quot; ah off line ,
well why do not we do that when we talk again , on , the eighth .
I do not , know what kind of food I will be , looking forward to eating at that point so ,
I will talk to you then ,
okay , that sounds good , so I will wait for your call , &quot; ah roughly eleven thirty , on , Thursday the eighth ,
great .
see you then .
I think we need to , &quot; ah continue this discussion , in another meeting ,
&quot; ah sooner the better ,
certainly within the next couple weeks , it is probably going to be , a couple of hours ,
&quot; ahm the only time , that is really bad for me ,
is , the first and the second actually up through the third to noon .
so I would like to do it next week if possible . &quot; ahm &quot; ah say Monday ,
in the morning ,
or , &quot; ahm sometime on Wednesday ?
well , Wednesday is not good ,
I am going on vacation ,
I will be leaving , on , Wednesday , and not coming back until the following Tuesday .
&quot; ahm and Monday morning , I have got , a meeting from nine to ten , and another one for eleven to twelve ,
so that does not really leave much time .
well actually I am arriving back in town on the first , so , and I have got classes and meetings on Tuesday .
so I could meet , at three o &apos;clock on Tuesday ,
or , Friday the fifth I could meet , again at three o &apos;clock .
Friday the fifth ,
is out for me .
I am in , seminars all day . although Friday the twenty ninth , is &quot; ah ,
a good time , anytime , on &quot; ah , the twenty ninth ,
well , if you want to , fly to Colorado and go skiing then , that is a possibility .
but , otherwise , &quot; ahm how about Tuesday the second at three .
was that possible ?
oops yeah ,
I guess you leave the twenty seventh ,
so that would not be so good ,
although a Colorado meeting does not sound bad , &quot; ahm no I am still out of town on , &quot; ah the second ,
&quot; ahm but I will be in the office on Wednesday , after , twelve .
&quot; ahm let me see ,
you will actually be gone on the twenty seventh .
so that is bad for you ,
so how about , &quot; ah Wednesday the third ,
&quot; ahm after twelve o &apos;clock .
well this sound more promising , &quot; ahm I have a meeting , from one to two , but I could meet anytime after two .
what about , two thirty .
&quot; ah two thirty would be perfect .
&quot; ah I think that will give us enough time to , &quot; ah cover what we have to handle .
so ,
&quot; ahm let us set it up for , &quot; ah two thirty on Wednesday the third ,
and , &quot; ah same place ,
I guess ,
great .
sounds good .
I am glad we found something .
okay ,
hold on a minute . &quot; ah I just realized , let us go ahead and set up another meeting in the next two weeks .
can we &quot; ah , do that
sure .
I think that is a good idea .
how about , &quot; ahm either , Monday morning , or , Wednesday afternoon .
I guess Tuesday morning would be good too .
&quot; ah okay .
my mornings are , pretty booked up at this point .
&quot; ah &quot; ah wait , you said Wednesday .
how about &quot; ah , Wednesday the , sixth of October .
I am free all day on Wednesday .
well , unfortunately I am going to be away , from the fourth , through the sixth .
&quot; ahm on , Wednesday the twenty ninth ,
I have got time , anytime in the afternoon ,
and , I have got time Thursday , the , thirtieth , in afternoon after two .
okay .
let me see .
those times do not look too good .
&quot; ahm it is going to have to be at least a two hour meeting I think ,
probably , so ,
&quot; ah let me see . you are gone the four to sixth ,
&quot; ah both those times you mentioned are bad for me .
&quot; ahm pretty much , Thursday the thirtieth , and Wednesday the twenty ninth are , booked up .
&quot; ahm &quot; ahm Monday and Tuesday , both , the twenty seventh twenty eighth ,
you are going to be gone the fourth through the sixth .
so ,
the twenty seventh twenty eighth , I am free in the afternoon ,
&quot; ahm it is , pretty , unless you want to do a lunch time meeting , on the seventh of October .
or like I said , the afternoon of the twenty seventh twenty eighth .
how is that .
well ,
seventh and eighth I have seminars from , ten to five . so I will not have any time then .
&quot; ahm if you do not have , mornings on the twenty seventh or the twenty eighth ,
it looks like my weeks are pretty full .
what about , &quot; ahm on the weekend of the second or the third , sometime , in the afternoon .
&quot; ah the , afternoon of the third would be perfect .
okay , well ,
I have a lunch meeting that is going to go until , about two . so how about three o &apos;clock .
three to five . and that will , give us some time ,
if we need to go afterwards .
&quot; ah three o &apos;clock , &quot; ah three to five on , Sunday the third . that is perfect for me .
okay , see you then .
okay ,
it looks we ought to have another meeting sometime , in the next couple of weeks , &quot; ah my schedule , is pretty tight , for , the next few weeks ,
&quot; ahm this next week , I am pretty booked , solid the whole day ,
&quot; ahm unless you want to meet , sometime ,
say the first through the third , &quot; ahm or we could do weekends or evenings ,
whatever ,
hm the only time I would have , the first the third during the day would be , on Tuesday ,
and that is from twelve thirty to two ,
but , I am not sure if that will be long enough .
&quot; ahm let us see .
I could meet , on , Saturday , the fourth , after two ,
that would be possible for me ,
Saturday the fourth ,
looks good .
that is fine for me , and , &quot; ah yeah ,
my schedule is pretty tight though ,
it looks like we are going to have to make it a weekend ,
so ,
let us do it , &quot; ah Saturday the fourth ?
is two o &apos;clock fine ?
or do you want to make it a little bit later , whatever is convenient .
it would actually be better for me if I made it , at , two thirty or three ,
let us say three o &apos;clock then . how about that .
we will go with three o &apos;clock , on Saturday the fourth .
that sounds great .
so three o &apos;clock , Saturday , the fourth of December .
alright , great , see you then ,
you know I , heard some of the things that you said in the meeting today ,
and I would , really like to &quot; ah , get together with you sometime , &quot; ahm in May ? would that be okay with you ?
yeah sure .
that would be great .
&quot; ahm how about , well ,
actually as I look in my book here &quot; ahm , I , go on vacation , on the first , and I will be gone through the fifteenth . I am going to toast ,
in sunny Bahamas . &quot; ah but , I am available starting the &quot; ah , seventeenth .
oh .
going to the Bahamas ,
well .
okay .
&quot; ah I guess we can do it , like at the end of May ,
&quot; ahm are you going to be busy the week you come back ?
or , going to be recuperating ? or what .
well I will probably be recuperating , but &quot; ah , &quot; ah let us see ,
the seventeenth , I have a meeting from , ten $ A- $ M to five $ P- $ M ,
so I will not be recuperating , too much on that day .
however on May eighteenth , I am available in the morning .
hm &quot; ah the eighteenth is not good for me ,
I got a , pottery class in the morning ,
and then I have to go , &quot; ahm do my crew team later that day .
&quot; ah how about , the twentieth . &quot; ah that is a Thursday ?
&quot; ahm I am free all day then .
how about you .
I have a meeting in the morning on the twentieth ,
&quot; ah from nine $ A- $ M to eleven ,
but , &quot; ah I am available after that ,
so actually , we could , meet for lunch and make it a lunch meeting , if you would like .
well I always like the Oakside Inn , and their sushi .
or we could try Ali Baba &apos;s for middle eastern food .
&quot; ahm I would think I would go for the Oakside Inn .
&quot; ahm I have had problems with Arabs in the past .
okay great , then &quot; ah the Oakside Inn it is , at &quot; ah , what noon ?
on , Thursday the twentieth ?
yeah , noon would be great .
okay thanks . see you then ,
so Cindy ,
I think we should , get together , sometime ,
&quot; ahm as soon as possible ,
&quot; ah to talk about some things that ,
you brought up in the meeting .
okay great , sounds good to me ,
&quot; ah I have some time available , on Tuesday June first ,
at , &quot; ah twelve noon ,
we could have a lunch meeting .
actually I am busy , all day , Tuesday ,
&quot; ahm hm how is Thursday .
&quot; ah the third ? &quot; ahm let us see , twelve , or on ,
gee ,
Thursday is no good for me ,
I am going to &quot; ah take a , rather long vacation , &quot; ah from Wednesday to Friday , and make a long weekend of it .
&quot; ah but I am available , on &quot; ah June seventh , that is Monday , all day .
well ,
I believe someone does not want us to get together ,
because , from the seventh to the ninth , I am , out of town ,
so ,
and then &quot; ah I have then &quot; ah Thursday the tenth , &quot; ah noon on , and Friday I am totally free .
actually all this month , Fridays , are lovely for me .
well Friday the eleventh ,
&quot; ah does not look , so great ,
I have got a seminar from &quot; ah nine $ A- $ M to twelve noon ,
and I would like to keep the afternoon free .
&quot; ahm how about , &quot; ah Thursday the seventeenth of June ,
Thursday is fine , &quot; ahm anytime after noon , would be great with me , on the seventeenth ? then ?
great terrific then , &quot; ah one $ P- $ M ? on the seventeenth ?
that sounds fantastic .
okay great , see you then ,
so Cindy ,
&quot; ahm I believe it is imperative , that we meet sometime as , soon as possible ,
&quot; ahm excepting this week ,
because I am on vacation .
&quot; ah boy that is too bad , because &quot; ah , I am out of town , on business , from the nineteenth , through the twenty first . however ,
I will be back on the twenty second ,
&quot; ah that is Thursday , and I am available in the afternoon ,
hm well that Thursday and Friday ,
&quot; ah both days I am going to be , working late ,
&quot; ah I have meetings , with &quot; ah the accountants ,
so ,
the week after that , &quot; ah starting the twenty sixth , any day , there , is fine with me ,
except for Tuesday .
well ,
I am , busy in the afternoon of &quot; ah the twenty sixth , that is Monday ,
but , I could &quot; ah have a , morning meeting with you , on that day ,
okay , that sounds good , &quot; ah Monday , the twenty sixth , how is , &quot; ah nine ? nineish ?
nine o &apos;clock is good , I will tell you what , I will reserve &quot; ah the small conference room . down here in Wean ,
okay , great . &quot; ah thanks a lot .
&quot; ahm so I will , see you here then .
okay Cindy , I think you and me need to have a talk , sometime pretty soon .
okay , sure that will be great , &quot; ah the only problem is I am on vacation all of next week .
I can not wait to get the heck out of here , I need a rest .
okay , well , fine . &quot; ahm are you going to be back Monday ?
yeah , I will be back Monday the ninth except ,
that is my , first day back in town and I know it will probably be pretty hectic for me ,
well Cindy ,
this is very important ,
I think we should meet as soon as , possible . &quot; ahm &quot; ah I have class on Monday ,
but , anytime , after one or two &quot; ah I am free .
&quot; ah how about you .
well I do not know ,
I really would prefer later in the week ,
like perhaps &quot; ah Wednesday or Thursday ?
that is the eleventh or the twelfth ?
I am free all day on those two days .
well , I am not , and that is really the only thing that matters .
&quot; ahm how about Friday .
okay , fine .
&quot; ah how is , two , on Friday .
are you going to be free then ?
sure , two $ P- $ M on &quot; ah August twentieth .
&quot; ah that is Friday .
that sounds great to me .
fine , I will , see you then .
so Cindy , we are going to , need to get together , sometime , this month .
yeah ,
&quot; ah I am free ,
let us see &quot; ahm ,
Monday really is not very good for me ,
I have got a meeting from ten $ A- $ M to eleven , and then again from two to four .
but Tuesday would be good , &quot; ah after , say one $ P- $ M .
hm well , actually for me , next week , really , sucks .
so , &quot; ahm ,
how about ,
would the &quot; ah , week of the twenty third be alright ? I mean or is that too late .
&quot; ah that week looks , pretty good to me ,
I have got &quot; ah , all day free on Wednesday the twenty fourth , or Friday the twenty sixth .
okay , great .
how about &quot; ah , Friday , &quot; ah one in the afternoon ?
one in the afternoon would be fine , but I would rather do it , in the morning . if it is possible .
well I have got class in the morning . &quot; ahm until eleven .
so , I can not really .
sorry .
well that is okay . then we will make it &quot; ah , one $ P- $ M , on Friday the twenty sixth of March .
okay , great .
so I will see you back here then .
hey , Cindy ,
I really think we should , get together for a meeting sometime , &quot; ah this month would be , fantastic for me ,
&quot; ah when are you free ?
well let us see ,
if you want to meet , as soon as possible &quot; ah ,
tomorrow morning , &quot; ah the sixth of April , is good for me .
or , if not , the seventh in the afternoon .
tomorrow ?
I am going out of town . &quot; ah tomorrow and the next day ,
and , then I have ,
next week really , sucks .
I have like seminars , and , stuff like that .
&quot; ahm hm see the next week I have ,
hm pretty busy then too ,
yeah that week , really , sucks too .
&quot; ah how about , the week after that . the week of the nineteenth ?
my goodness , but you seem to have a busy schedule .
&quot; ahm the week of the nineteenth is , fairly busy for me too ,
although I do have hm ,
some blocks of time , available , for a meeting .
well , I am a mover , I am a shaker .
&quot; ahm let us say , okay , well when are you , available &quot; ah , the week of the nineteenth .
I am free , all Tuesday and Wednesday , &quot; ahm and Monday morning .
well I guess I could schedule Monday morning ,
but I was hoping to sleep in that day . &quot; ahm ,
Tuesday , I am available in the morning , and also Wednesday afternoon .
Tuesday morning would be good .
&quot; ahm yeah that would be great .
we could &quot; ah , catch breakfast somewhere . some , where maybe .
okay , that sounds good to me . what time should we say .
nine , $ A- $ M ? on Tuesday , the , twentieth ?
yeah , nine $ A- $ M would be good .
&quot; ahm we could go to &quot; ah , the &quot; ah , bagel shop , that is down the street from , here , actually .
that would be fine with me . it is pretty good .
okay , that sounds good .
I assume it is on your expense account .
actually I know the owner . so , it will be pretty free , actually .
well you are a mover and a shaker .
okay , that , sounds great .
I will meet you there at nine $ A- $ M .
okay .
see you then .
&quot; ah should I pick you up ?
well , I think it would be best if I just meet you there .
suit yourself .
okay , see you then . &quot; ah
okay ,
let us look at , the week of , January twenty fifth ,
&quot; ahm Tuesday and Thursday , are pretty much out for me ,
but , either Monday or Wednesday , or even Friday , I am open , pretty much all day .
okay ,
let us look at that , first week in February then ,
I am out of town until the second ,
I get back on the third ,
we could meet , Wednesday , afternoon ? after twelve o &apos;clock ,
Thursday is completely out , &quot; ahm it looks like , Friday is completely out , as well .
okay ,
with this schedule , on the third , I could meet after two o &apos;clock on the third ,
but , that is about the only time I have free that day because I am , tied up , from about ten in the morning , to about two in the afternoon ,
is that okay by you ?
sure ,
that is great , &quot; ahm yeah , like I said ,
I am out , at noon ,
so ,
do you want to meet from , three to five ?
we can , give that a shot then .
whichever is better for you , we could either meet , two to four , or three to five .
do you have a preference ?
yeah ,
why do not we just , &quot; ahm put it at the end of the day ,
and , go , from three to five .
if that is okay with you ,
that will be fine . so it is , Wednesday the third , from three o &apos;clock to five o &apos;clock , at , my office ,
yeah , that is great , we will see you then , at three o &apos;clock .
bye bye ,
yep , bye , see you then ,
hey Russell , we are trying to set up a meeting ,
&quot; ahm if we are looking at , the , last full week in May , the only days I have ,
are the twenty fourth , and the twenty fifth ,
&quot; ah basically , in the morning . we could even , stretch over into , lunch time if we need to ,
is that really the only time you are free ?
that week I would rather get it done that last week in May , and not have to not push it into June if possible , but ,
if we could , start , around lunch time ,
either the twenty fourth or ,
well the twenty fifth is really out for me entirely . but if could start on the twenty fourth , at noon ,
I could swing that . or ,
I have got a lot of free time the end of that week ,
I am getting ready to go out of town , on the thirty first ,
so I have been leaving that open just for such an occasion ,
are you free then ?
actually , Wednesday through Friday of that week , I am , busy ,
I have a seminar from nine thirty to four thirty each day ,
and , Monday the twenty fourth ,
I , have a meeting ,
starting at one ,
so ,
it looks like we would not get two hours in ,
&quot; ah so unfortunately it looks like , we are , at the next week ,
unless you have another idea ,
no , it ,
looks like that ,
last week in May is out , I was trying to avoid this ,
because I am out of town until , the second of June ,
and we really need to meet , before the fifth , &quot; ahm I have got some free time on the third or fourth ,
we have got to get this done , so when are you free ,
well , the third , &quot; ahm I basically have open , after , ten o &apos;clock ,
we could meet right at ten ,
and , on Friday we could do a lunch meeting ,
or we could meet from three to five .
again on Friday ,
well ,
I could do the lunch meeting on Friday but I would rather not , leave it until the last day ,
could you meet , at eleven o &apos;clock on Thursday of the third ?
or , anytime that afternoon actually would be fine by me ,
I just , have meeting until eleven and I could not meet before then .
sure it looks like ,
&quot; ah Thursday the third , is it ,
I would rather not , meet , over lunch , because , &quot; ahm , I would , like to eat lunch ,
but , why do not we say , one to three on Thursday ,
okay ,
one to three is great ,
and then ,
if we both still have some time on the Friday the fourth ,
if we need to go overtime , but , let us , talk about that on Thursday , as the meeting is ending ,
so one to three on Thursday the third ,
I will just meet you at your , office .
okay ?
great , yeah , I , will see you here . &quot; ahm see you then ,
have a good time , with that seminar , I will see you , on the third .
hi Russell , we are trying to set up a meeting , &quot; ah two hours , &quot; ahm to go over that proposal .
let us see .
&quot; ahm Monday July the twenty sixth , would be okay if you want to meet first thing in the morning ,
or , we could meet after lunch . or the twenty seventh is pretty free , for me up until the twenty seventh .
how are those those days for you .
Timothy ,
those days are actually pretty bad ,
I am in a seminar with Allied Chemicals . all the way through the twenty seventh ,
so ,
how about , after the the twenty eighth is a little bad unless you can do late afternoon , but I can do mornings on the twenty ninth ,
or ,
the thirtieth is actually free for me entirely .
which , would probably be the best day for me that week if you could swing it ,
well , the twenty eighth , afternoon is bad for me , and , so is the twenty ninth , in the morning ,
then I am going out of town and I will be in $ D $ C until , &quot; ahm the third ,
so we could meet , &quot; ahm the fourth sometime ,
that is Wednesday , &quot; ahm that is in August ,
I understand it is getting late .
&quot; ahm we could meet ,
I have got , a meeting from eleven to one .
so ,
what is Wednesday like .
Timothy ,
Wednesday I am clear after eleven o &apos;clock .
so anytime after your meeting would be fine by me , &quot; ahm I am free until five ,
what would be best for you ,
I do not know ,
where your meeting is , or where you need to come from , so you tell me ,
well ,
it looks like we can schedule , Wednesday , &quot; ahm let us say ,
one thirty to three thirty . on , Wednesday the fourth .
&quot; ahm unless that is , not good ,
no that sounds like a done deal .
probably the best we would be able to handle on that week , because I leave on a Friday .
I am going out of town for vacation , so , that was one thirty on , Wednesday the fourth ?
yes . that is one thirty .
why do not I , stop by your office .
if you , need to , give me a call if we need to change it . let me know ,
sounds great , and I will , see you on the fourth ,
so Torsten , I guess we have to meet , sometime in the , next two weeks for a couple hours ,
I am sorry , I was talking to my secretary . can you repeat that ?
so , I guess we have to meet , sometime , in the next couple of weeks , for , two hours .
when , do you want to do that .
well , there are still some details I want to discuss with you .
so if you do not mind , I would like to meet , for a couple hours .
yeah ,
I agree with you . &quot; ahm let us see ,
&quot; ah boy . next couple weeks , looks &quot; ah , pretty busy , in my book , &quot; ahm any suggestions ?
how about &quot; ah , Wednesday the , tenth of March ,
no ,
I will be &quot; ah , out of town , ninth tenth and eleventh ,
so ,
&quot; ah how about , Friday after that , the twelfth .
&quot; ahm I have a seminar then , from eight to five , that , will not work .
&quot; ahm maybe , Tuesday , after noon ?
or , Monday , in the morning ? Monday the fifteenth . in the morning .
well , I am busy on Monday , but Tuesday afternoon , sounds good , &quot; ahm how long do you think we will need ?
about two hours , so , how about from , two to four .
right after lunch .
on , Tuesday the ninth .
&quot; ah I thought you meant &quot; ah , Tuesday the sixteenth .
&quot; ahm I am still out of town on the ninth .
it would have to be Tuesday afternoon on the sixteenth .
&quot; ah right . &quot; ahm Tuesday the sixteenth would be fine .
two to four then .
okay ?
okay , that is okay .
I will see you then , bye ,
hello , Dr Noah ?
hi Tor , &quot; ah let us set up a meeting , for a , couple hours in the next , two weeks ,
&quot; ahm when is good for you ,
hm that is a good question .
&quot; ahm let us see , pretty busy , &quot; ahm how , about , Friday , the second , in the morning .
I am busy that morning , but , I would be free , &quot; ah on the morning of , Monday ?
the afternoon of Tuesday , or , all day Wednesday at the end of this month ,
do any of those times work for you ?
hm Monday the twenty ninth ? &quot; ah how about at two thirty , I could do it ,
no , I am only free on , the mornings of Monday .
&quot; ahm let us see .
if those other two dates do not work ,
&quot; ahm when else am I free ,
&quot; ah &quot; ah this is tight . &quot; ahm well let us see . well how did those other dates look .
the afternoon of the thirtieth , or , Wednesday the thirty first .
well Wednesday the thirty first is definitely bad .
&quot; ahm Tuesday ,
no I have class , from nine to eleven ,
&quot; ahm maybe over lunch , I will tell you what , let me cancel , my class .
because we really need to talk ,
and I will , I will just schedule the final for some other day .
okay ?
that is true ,
the students can wait for us , we have more important things , so &quot; ah ,
Tuesday nine $ A- $ M then . &quot; ahm we will , meet over , in my office then .
okay ?
sounds good .
Tuesday &quot; ah , morning , nine $ A- $ M , on the thirtieth , &quot; ahm
hey Noah , let us , &quot; ah meet , in the , next couple weeks .
&quot; ahm I am really confused about this stuff ,
yeah ,
that is a good idea , frankly your work has not been up to par last couple weeks ,
and I think I should talk with you about your , results , &quot; ahm let us see ,
I will be free , &quot; ahm after , two $ P- $ M on Wednesday , February third .
how is that with you ,
well ,
I am free Wednesday afternoon on the third ,
but I would really like to meet a little bit earlier ,
are you free &quot; ah this Monday the twenty fifth ? in the , &quot; ah morning ?
no ,
Monday is a , pretty busy schedule .
&quot; ahm I could meet , after three $ P- $ M , on Tuesday the twenty sixth .
if you want to meet , earlier ,
but then I will be out of town until , &quot; ah February second ,
yeah ,
I guess it is going to have to be &quot; ah , Wednesday the third because , I am busy Tuesday ,
and if you are going to be out of town ,
&quot; ah so Wednesday , afternoon . how about , two o &apos;clock .
we will do it two to four , Wednesday the third .
that would be fine , and , I want to see some results by then .
okay ?
hey listen &quot; ah do you have a second ?
I would like to &quot; ah , schedule a meeting with you , in the next couple weeks .
would that be okay ?
yeah , sure , &quot; ah when do you want , to meet . for how long .
well I figure it will take about , two hours , &quot; ahm let us see my ,
best time would be on Tuesday June first .
&quot; ahm morning or afternoon would be good for that , how is that .
&quot; ahm I am going to be out of town , at that time ,
&quot; ahm let us see ,
better for me would be &quot; ah Thursday ,
&quot; ah May , twenty seventh ?
no , I am busy that morning , &quot; ahm let us see .
afternoon of the twenty fourth ?
or , after two $ P- $ M on the twenty fifth ?
or , anytime after ten thirty on the twenty sixth would be , okay with me ,
hm no , according to my schedule book I will be busy those times , &quot; ahm anytime on the thirty first ?
no like I said , I will be , out of town from the thirty first , to the second in ,
&quot; ah Germany . drinking some , fine beer ,
yeah , &quot; ah I wish I was there with you ,
&quot; ahm alright how about sometime after that ,
&quot; ahm maybe , Thursday the third ,
when you get back , &quot; ah sometime in the afternoon ?
okey doke . Thursday , the , third , at , &quot; ah two $ P- $ M would be great for me ,
alright , I will come to your office then , see you then ,
hi .
&quot; ah we need to , set up a meeting in the next two weeks to , &quot; ahm discuss , some details of our plan ,
how about , for about two hours , when , do you have time free ,
yeah ,
we should really &quot; ah get this plan out of the way ,
&quot; ahm let us see ,
how about ,
hm this Monday ,
the twenty sixth ,
in the afternoon sometime .
nope , I am , busy that whole day ,
&quot; ahm late afternoon of the twenty eight , would be good , or the morning of the twenty ninth ,
how is that with you ,
nope , no can do ,
&quot; ahm let us see ,
then I will be out of town on the thirtieth , and second and third , of August ,
&quot; ahm I guess we will have to do it when I come back ,
&quot; ahm we could do it , early morning Wednesday , or late afternoon Wednesday ,
okay ,
late afternoon , Wednesday ,
the fourth , would be , fine with me ,
let us say ,
&quot; ah is two $ P- $ M ? okay with you ,
alright ,
two $ P- $ M sounds good and , I will put you in for , two hours ,
I think that is all we will need ,
so I will just see you then ,
&quot; ah we will meet at my office ?
yeah , yeah , let us do that , &quot; ahm okay , bye ,
maybe we should get together to talk further about this .
&quot; ah how about sometime in the next couple of weeks .
okay , well I will be on vacation for the next two weeks , &quot; ah how about , Friday the twenty first .
Friday the twenty first is scheduled , from early morning to late afternoon .
&quot; ah could you , perhaps , choose another day ? a morning on a Wednesday ?
or , early afternoon on a Tuesday ?
mornings on Wednesdays seem bad .
&quot; ah how about the twenty seventh , twenty eighth , or thirty first .
do any of those three days suit you ?
I have , &quot; ahm an indefinite length thing scheduled at ten $ A- $ M , on the twenty seventh , but , I should be able to get away from that , within an hour or so ,
how about , &quot; ah shortly after noon on the twenty seventh .
okay , the twenty seventh sounds fine .
&quot; ah pick a time ,
how about one $ P- $ M of the twenty seventh .
where do you think we should meet .
we will meet at my office , if you do not mind ,
sounds good to me , what , is your office .
what number . would it be .
it is the interact lab .
here in Wean Hall .
good I will meet you there . this is , one $ P- $ M on the twenty seventh .
maybe we should get , together sometime , and talk about this a little longer .
do you have anything free in your schedule , &quot; ah from , day after tomorrow on ?
well I will be on vacation the , &quot; ah second , third , and fourth .
I am taking the family to Cancun .
&quot; ahm how about the seventh .
or the ninth .
or maybe even the fourteenth or seventeenth .
well it looks like I am out of town , on the seventh and the ninth ,
but the fourteenth is open ,
&quot; ah what time suits you then .
how about two o &apos;clock in the afternoon .
we will meet at your office , if you do not mind .
do you still know where it is from last time ? or is this something new .
nope , I still remember where it is .
I will see you there .
see you there ,
&quot; ah maybe you would like to meet further on this . &quot; ahm unfortunately , it looks like I am going to be going on vacation shortly ,
so ,
if we could schedule some time this afternoon ,
that would be good .
that does not seem very possible , &quot; ahm if you are going , to be on vacation here in the next few days , and I will be out of town next week .
&quot; ah what if we schedule it for the twenty seventh or twenty eighth .
do either of those two days suit you ?
the twenty seventh does not work , but I have all of the twenty eighth open . is there a time you would like ?
I prefer afternoon meetings myself , so , &quot; ah pick a time in the afternoon .
one o &apos;clock would probably be good , &quot; ah how about your , &quot; ah lab
okay .
sounds good .
I will see you then .
see you then .
okay .
I guess we should , &quot; ah try and get together on this , &quot; ah sometime in August ,
&quot; ah do you have any time on the second ? or the week following ?
I am going to be taking a vacation to , &quot; ah sunny Pittsburgh . between the second and the sixth ,
&quot; ah but the next week seems fairly free .
how about the ninth , eleventh , or twelfth .
on the ninth , &quot; ah I could probably , &quot; ah pencil you in for one $ P- $ M ,
&quot; ah the eleventh is busy .
and the twelfth would be ,
&quot; ah tuck it in a crack around noon .
you say one o &apos;clock on the ninth is good for you ?
yes .
I think I could make one o &apos;clock on the ninth , that suits you , where would you like to meet .
we will meet here in the lab , if that is okay with you ,
yeah .
that is fine with me .
meet you in the lab then , &quot; ah one o &apos;clock on , the ninth of August .
I will see you then .
thank you .
you are welcome .
see you then .
so , maybe we should figure out a way to get back together again .
perhaps in the next two weeks .
okay , well , how does the seventeenth look on your calendar .
seventeenth looks pretty full . I have , less then a half an hour left at the end of the day . before five o &apos;clock .
how about the eighteenth .
in the afternoon .
I do not have , two hours free on the eighteenth , there is only one hour at three $ P- $ M .
how about the afternoon of the sixteenth .
okay , that sounds good to me . shall we meet at say , two o &apos;clock ?
two o &apos;clock on the sixteenth ?
seems pretty good to me .
I will write that in .
okay .
I will see you then .
okay , very good .
it will be impossible for me to make a meeting this afternoon . &quot; ahm how about toward the end of next week .
say , Friday the sixteenth ?
Friday the sixteenth looks , good , as long as I can get away by four $ P- $ M .
then how about a one o &apos;clock meeting .
&quot; ah you said , you would like to meet for two hours , is that good ?
okay then , Friday , one o &apos;clock , two hours , with Sam Helwig . I will write it in .
where would you like to meet .
well ,
we have got , space in my office , but there is other people that might get disturbed ,
how about your office .
okay , that sounds fine .
I will meet you at your office , at one o &apos;clock , on Friday the sixteenth of April .
my office is , forty six oh seven .
see you then .
I am sorry ,
your time is up . we can continue this conversation , &quot; ah sometime in the next two weeks .
it will have be before , the end of two weeks . because of the deadline .
so , do you have any time free next week ? or the week after ?
well there is a slight problem ,
in that I am on vacation from the third , to the fourteenth . which seem to bring us to the end of our , allotted time .
so , I think we are going to have to work something out , that we can extend the deadline somehow .
well , where are you going ?
maybe I can go with you .
I am going fishing in Alberta , with my thirteen year old son .
&quot; ah that is really terrible , because of this allergy I have for fish .
&quot; ahm okay ,
I will talk it over , with , the guy . and see if we can get , it extended .
but we have to do it as soon as possible .
when will you be back .
I will be back on the seventeenth .
and , &quot; ahm I will be free in the morning ,
&quot; ahm until ten $ A- $ M , that day ,
&quot; ahm and the next day I am free , until , two $ P- $ M , and then I have class , &quot; ahm until four .
alright .
on the seventeenth .
what do you say we meet , at eight $ A- $ M .
until ten .
I know , it will have to be a little bit early , but , we really have to get this done .
yeah , I think we could probably make it a working breakfast .
well breakfast never seems to work for me .
so , I guess you are right .
okay , why do not we meet at that restaurant down the street , &quot; ahm at eight $ A- $ M , on the seventeenth .
and if we need extra time we could probably meet on the eighteenth as well .
alright . but you are paying .
sounds good to me ,
where do have all this extra money from , anyway . we did not hand in the project yet .
you do not need to know .
okay . well ,
we are going to have to leave now .
but , we can , work on it some more in the next two weeks .
&quot; ahm I , only seem to have Thursdays and Fridays free .
&quot; ahm in the afternoon , on Thursday but , any time on Fridays . how about you .
well this , Thursday and Friday , &quot; ahm I am on vacation , and next Thursday is my day off .
&quot; ahm on the eleventh I am free in the afternoon , once I get back from my seminar though .
alright then , what do you say we work on it next Friday , the eleventh , in the afternoon .
what time .
well it is going to take me a while to get back from my seminar .
&quot; ahm I will probably be ready by twelve thirty . &quot; ahm and then we could , &quot; ah start by having lunch .
&quot; ahm and if we need more time than it takes us to eat , we can , &quot; ahm come back to either your or my office . and work on the rest .
sounds good to me ,
alright , I am looking forward to it .
okay .
we are going to have to call it quits now ,
but , I can meet you again next week on the twenty first .
how is that .
no , that will not be any , good .
&quot; ahm how about , &quot; ah the twenty third ?
in the morning ?
the twenty third ? &quot; ahm okay ,
that sounds good to me . I am free all day that day ,
so the morning will work .
how about , &quot; ahm ten $ A- $ M ?
that works for me , &quot; ahm I will be in my office , so you can just meet me there .
okay . and I will bring all this stuff with me .
alright , see you then .
okay . &quot; ahm what do you say we call it quits now , and , meet some time , &quot; ahm in the beginning of August .
I am going to have , &quot; ah conferences , all next week except , Monday .
I can , meet you in the afternoon if you like .
no , next week is no good ,
I am on vacation again . &quot; ahm but I will be back on Monday , and I am free all day Monday ,
okay . what do you say we meet , on Monday , around two ? $ P- $ M ?
sounds good , &quot; ahm why do not I meet you in your office this time , since all the stuff is there .
okay , I will just , have remember my key this time .
okay , see you then ,
bye .
well ,
I think we are going to have to , conclude now , and have , more of a meeting , in the next two weeks . what time is good for you .
&quot; ahm well today is the fifth ,
and , I am obviously not going to meet with you on the weekend ,
so ,
let us see ,
Monday I am , quite busy , all day ,
but Tuesday I am free in the afternoon ,
no ,
I am going to be , out of town on Tuesday .
as well as Wednesday and Thursday ,
but ,
I can meet , on Friday , from , one $ P- $ M to three , or , four to five ,
no , Friday is not any good , because I have got a seminar all day .
&quot; ahm the following Monday .
the fifteenth .
I am free in the morning ,
&quot; ahm and I am also free for lunch ,
how would that be for you ,
ten $ A- $ M to twelve ?
is that fine ?
yeah . that sounds great to me , why do not , &quot; ahm you meet me over at my office .
okay . is that the one on campus ?
yeah , it is in , &quot; ah Doherty $ Z basement .
okay . it looks like , we are going to have to meet some time in the next two weeks , again .
we are always running out of time .
&quot; ahm &quot; ah today is the fifth .
&quot; ahm I will be out of town for the sixth and seventh ,
I will not be able to meet on Thursday until five .
but that would only give us an hour .
and , &quot; ah Friday , I can meet any time until four .
how is Friday .
&quot; ahm well ,
it sounds like this week is shot ,
because , I can not make it on Friday ,
because I have got a seminar .
&quot; ah Monday and Tuesday I am on vacation , so , Wednesday the fourteenth .
all I have got is a doctor &apos;s appointment in the morning ,
and I would be able to meet you any time after ten $ A- $ M .
well , I could meet you , after ten $ A- $ M , and , I just have a class at two .
so , we could pick a time in there , we could probably eat over lunch in the Highlander , too .
&quot; ahm do you eat , at any specific time ?
no , I usually eat when I am hungry .
so , why do not you pick a time . and , &quot; ah I will try to be hungry then .
okay . how about if we meet , at , precisely , ten thirty six .
okay ,
but I might be a minute or two late . so , do not be surprised , if I am there at ten thirty seven .
no , I like promptness . I hope that you are on time .
I mean if you are planning to be late , we could just make it at a later time .
I will be there at ten thirty six .
&quot; ahm , I am going to be on vacation from , the second to the fifteenth .
&quot; ah , we have to do it sometime after that . would the Friday the twenty first work at all for you ?
I am free all day long .
&quot; ahm , Friday the twenty first does not look good .
I am going to be stuck in a seminar , from , eight $ A- $ M to five $ P- $ M all day long ?
&quot; ahm , what about Monday the twenty fourth .
that is really good for me , I have nothing scheduled that day .
&quot; ahm , great .
I am free until four o &apos;clock . so we can meet anytime before then . &quot; ah , when is a good time for you .
what about from one to three $ P- $ M .
I think that would be really good .
and , we would get enough time , to talk about , everything that we really want to .
okay , sounds good .
I will , meet you at one o &apos;clock , on &quot; ah , Monday the twenty fourth then .
Ian , &quot; ahm , I want to meet with you . we have some really important stuff to talk about ?
so , how about , Thursday the third ? from three to five $ P- $ M ? how does that , sound for you .
oh I would love to , but I am going to be on vacation again . &quot; ahm how about sometime next week .
I have got a lot of free time , on Monday and Wednesday .
&quot; ahm Monday through Wednesday I am going to be out of town ,
and , Thursday I am going to be stuck in a conference , from nine to eleven
and I do not know if I would really want to , go into another meeting right after that ,
what about Friday the eleventh ,
I am free all day .
&quot; ah my afternoon on Friday , is pretty free , &quot; ah we could meet at say two o &apos;clock ?
is that work for you ?
yeah , that is great .
two to , at least four on , Friday the eleventh , will be great .
we will meet then . okay ?
see you then .
Ian , it is urgent , I have to , meet up with you .
what about , today , say from one to three $ P- $ M ? how does that sound .
I have got a class , from , two to three thirty .
&quot; ah I am free all day tomorrow and Wednesday though .
&quot; ah are you free at all any of those days ?
&quot; ahm tomorrow , through , the twentieth , I am , on vacation , and I am attending seminars .
so . I really will not have any free time .
but &quot; ahm , I am going to get back , on Wednesday , the twenty first ,
and I will be free all day .
what about if we , meet up then .
&quot; ah , the twenty first is no good , I will be away on business .
&quot; ahm , how about the afternoon of the twenty second , or the twenty third .
&quot; ahm the afternoon , both , the twenty second and twenty third , I am going to be stuck in , three hour meetings . but &quot; ah the next best thing would be , Monday ,
the twenty sixth ,
I am free all day ,
any time good for you ?
&quot; ahm , the twenty sixth would be pretty good , could we meet at , ten in the morning ?
yeah ,
ten $ A- $ M in the morning would be great .
so , we will , meet , from like ten to twelve .
that will be fine .
great .
then I am looking forward to it .
&quot; ah Ian . I do not think we finished &quot; ah , discussing what we had to talk about .
so , what about if we meet up , on Monday . say around from two to four ?
&quot; ah , no , I am going to be on vacation again next week .
&quot; ah from the second to the sixth .
&quot; ahm how about the ninth the eleventh or the twelfth .
I am free , all day , on those days .
the ninth would be great .
say , what about , from &quot; ah , two to four $ P- $ M ? that day ?
that would be , great for me ,
okay then , I will see you from , two to four on the ninth .
Ian , we need to discuss this issue further , what about if we meet on &quot; ah , March the twenty third ?
&quot; ah , all day is good for me , so , you just pick a time ,
okay , well I have got a class from nine to twelve .
&quot; ahm , could we meet at , say &quot; ah , two o &apos;clock ?
two to four would be just great .
and then &quot; ah , we can wrap up what we started talking about here .
see you then ,
Ian , I think we should meet up again .
&quot; ah what about , April the twentieth , that is a Tuesday .
I am free , all day .
&quot; ah , anything good for you ?
well ,
I have got a meeting in the afternoon .
but I could meet &quot; ah , during lunch or &quot; ah ,
at say ten in the morning ?
&quot; ah , we probably would not have enough time to discuss this over lunch but &quot; ah . ten $ A- $ M sounds good ,
say from about , ten to noon ?
how about that .
&quot; ah , sounds great .
so I will see you on , Tuesday the twentieth , at , ten $ A- $ M .
&quot; ah from the second to the fifteenth I am going to be on vacation &quot; ah we are going to have to do it sometime after that .
are you free , on the twenty first ?
nope , got a seminar all . day .
&quot; ahm , I am looking at , anywhere the twenty fourth ?
all day I am free , or , afternoon , on the twenty fifth .
okay why do not we try to meet on the morning of the twenty fourth .
I have got a four $ P- $ M doctor &apos;s appointment . but I can meet any time before that .
how about two o &apos;clock , or no you have to be out at four .
so , one o &apos;clock .
that will give us enough time to recuperate from the morning on a Monday .
okay sounds good . I will see you at &quot; ah one o &apos;clock on the twenty fourth .
okay Ian .
we got to schedule , a meeting , I am looking at , any Friday ? or any Monday but the seventh .
what does it look like for you .
&quot; ah Fridays are good in the afternoon .
except for the fourth .
&quot; ah could you meet on the eleventh ?
at say two o &apos;clock ?
sounds great ?
two o &apos;clock , on the eleventh .
you know what Ian ?
I think we got to get together again in a couple weeks .
&quot; ahm how does you schedule look .
I am a little busy but I think we can &quot; ah work something out .
are you free any time next week ?
maybe in the afternoon ?
actually , Monday the eighth . &quot; ah I think a two hour meeting would be good enough for us from maybe three to five .
but Mondays , I would think are pretty bad .
&quot; ahm as far as Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday goes I am out , Friday is booked solid .
I am probably looking at something maybe on the lines of the nineteenth . from three to five it is a Friday ,
what do you think .
I have got a seminar from eight to five on Friday , that is no good .
&quot; ahm , maybe Monday the twenty second or , Wednesday the twenty fourth ?
Monday the twenty second sounds , good .
I am looking at probably anywhere from two to four . because twelve I am breaking for lunch .
okay then &quot; ah we could plan to meet , at two on Monday the twenty second ?
sounds great ?
I will mark it down in my book .
well Ian ,
it is deja vu again . we need to get another meeting going this April ,
&quot; ahm , two hour meeting again .
&quot; ahm I am looking at maybe , hopefully by the end of this week .
what do you say .
well I am free &quot; ah , Tuesday morning , and Wednesday afternoon .
other than that I am , pretty much packed .
no good .
I am out of town those days .
let us see .
how about , I am looking at Monday the twelfth .
any time free then ?
on Monday and Tuesday I am going to be on vacation .
are you free any , time later that weekend ?
I have got afternoons free on the fourteenth fifteenth and all day the sixteenth .
sixteenth sounds good . any time , a meeting before , two o &apos;clock . because I am out of there at four .
okay then . why do not we meet at say ten and we can do brunch .
sounds great ? what kind of food .
&quot; ahm , anything is fine with me I do not really care .
Italian . because I am a sucker for Italian .
sounds good , I will see you then .
so . we should meet again .
how about next week ?
what days are good for you ,
actually , next week , I am on vacation .
gosh , I guess we will have to meet the week after that .
&quot; ahm , how about Monday .
&quot; ah , Monday the tenth ?
well unfortunately , my vacation , &quot; ah runs through the fourteenth , and I have nonrefundable plane tickets .
I was planning on being on a beach in Acapulco about that point ,
well , when are you getting back .
I get back on the fifteenth ,
rest up on the sixteenth ,
which is a Sunday ,
and I am back at work on the seventeenth ,
but I have a seminar all day .
I think the first day that is really good for me is the eighteenth .
that is a Tuesday .
okay , want to have lunch ?
that sounds pretty good , are you available just before noon ?
we can meet at noon ,
sounds good .
&quot; ah , on campus or off .
your choice ,
I say if I have got enough money to go to Acapulco ,
I have got enough money to go to one of those silly places on Craig street .
how about Great Scott .
sounds great .
except they have been out of business for a while . how about some other place . let us just wander up Craig and ,
pick one we like that day .
that sounds pretty good , okay , &quot; ahm I will meet you , outside , Cyert Hall , at noon .
does that sound alright for you ?
see you then ,
roger , over and out .
thought it was , roger , wilco .
oh , no it is what we always say when we are talking on screen ,
well .
looks like we , should get together again . &quot; ahm ,
I am free , either Thursday afternoons , or , all day Fridays . what is good for you .
how about &quot; ah , Friday the eleventh , sometime in the afternoon .
sounds great .
how about two .
two is fine .
where would you like to meet .
&quot; ah want to come over to my office ?
sure , are you still in Wean Hall someplace ?
yep . forty one twenty seven .
okay , no problem .
I will just come over there at two on the eleventh .
see you then ,
okay .
okay .
well , I guess we should meet .
but , my time is a little tight , this week ,
in fact , I can not meet at all .
unless we do it this afternoon ,
how about , next Wednesday , or , Thursday morning .
or Friday morning , for that matter .
well ,
I teach until three thirty today , but I could meet you &quot; ahm , you know like at three forty five , if you wanted ,
&quot; ahm ,
I am afraid that I am out of town , &quot; ah next week ,
and , I come back on Thursday ,
but I am tied up in the morning .
&quot; ahm Friday I have completely free .
that would be Friday the twenty third .
&quot; ah , well , why do not we just me on twenty third ?
let us get an early start at nine .
sound good ?
well , I probably would not be thinking too straight at nine , ten or ten thirty would really be better for me ,
okay , let us do it at ten .
okay , see you there ,
see you .
so ,
we should meet .
&quot; ahm this week is not good for me I am sorry ,
next week , is not good for me , &quot; ah ,
except for Monday afternoon .
&quot; ahm , how is that for you .
is that , &quot; ahm Monday the ninth ?
&quot; ah no ,
I believe that is , Monday ,
the second of August .
although we could also meet on the ninth , in the afternoon ,
if you prefer ,
&quot; ahm I am afraid that I am using some of my , copious , vacation time , the first week of August .
&quot; ahm the ninth is really the first day that I have open ,
but , I do not have anything else I have to schedule around .
so , any time that afternoon is fine with me .
okay , let us go for one thirty .
alright .
one thirty it is . &quot; ahm , where .
&quot; ah , let us meet right here .
okay , that sounds great .
I will , see you , here , at one thirty then .
hi I , think it is time we made another appointment ? &quot; ahm ?
what &quot; ah , would be good for you preferably in the week of the tenth to the fourteenth .
well , I have vacation in that entire week , and , the entire week before that .
&quot; ahm , I am available , &quot; ah starting the seventeenth for the rest of the month .
what time would be good for you on the seventeenth .

&quot; ahm , I will see you then ?

&quot; ahm , I am free most of the week from the twenty sixth to the thirtieth .
how is &quot; ah that for you .
well , &quot; ahm , both the twenty seventh and twenty eighth I do not have anything on my schedule .
so &quot; ahm , how about , &quot; ahm , sometime in the afternoon on the twenty seventh ?
I have got a seminar , all day on the , twenty seventh . that is the one day I am , not completely free that week .
&quot; ah the twenty eighth would be a little better how is then .
&quot; ah any time on the twenty eighth is fine . how about , two three o &apos;clock in the afternoon on the twenty eighth ?
okay , that sounds good .
hi . I think we need to set up another appointment . what &quot; ah time during the month would be good for you .
well , I have vacation , &quot; ahm , the first week of August from the second to the sixth .
how about , &quot; ahm , any Monday ?
in August , I do not have anything on my schedule those days .
I have got class every Monday from &quot; ah eight in the morning to one .
so I would prefer another day if ,
there is anything better , but if worse comes to worse we can do something &quot; ah in the afternoon .
&quot; ah Thursday the nineteenth would probably be better , I would have to , squeeze you in on the twelfth .
&quot; ahm , okay how about the nineteenth at maybe &quot; ah , two o &apos;clock in the afternoon ?
two o &apos;clock on the afternoon of the nineteenth is fine .
I will see you then .
okay , great .
&quot; ah hi .
I would like to make an appointment I was wondering &quot; ah ,
what time &quot; ah , in the next couple of weeks would be good for you ?
the seventeenth seems to be pretty clear for me , the seventeenth of March ?
&quot; ah I do not have anything on my , schedule then .
so , any time is fine with me .
the seventeenth is not very good for me I have a seminar , all day .
&quot; ahm , how is the &quot; ah twenty third or twenty fifth I am free all day then ,
the twenty third is , &quot; ah , fine , so is the twenty fifth .
on each of those days , I have class from nine , $ A- $ M to twelve noon .
so , any other time , is fine with me . why do not we make it for , three o &apos;clock on , the twenty third .
okay I will , see you then .
hi I would like to &quot; ah , make another appointment ?
I was wondering , what time &quot; ah would be good for you ,

I am free all day the eleventh .
okay , how about we meet , &quot; ah the afternoon of the eleventh .
say , &quot; ah one thirty , or two ?

but , &quot; ah the afternoon of the twenty second ,
or &quot; ah anytime , the twenty third ,

alright thanks , &quot; ah see you then .
bye .
so &quot; ah , Zaphod , I think the meeting went well . &quot; ahm , I think we made a lot of progress on this .
but , I think the widget problem needs a little work . and &quot; ah , we should maybe get together in May sometime .
&quot; ahm , sorry you are mispronouncing my name , it is Zaphod . &quot; ahm ,
let us see ,
for the next two weeks I will be on vacation .
&quot; ahm , how about the twenty first .
or the twenty eighth .
&quot; ahm , terribly sorry about that .
it is hard , you know when I only see your name in print , to pronounce it properly .
&quot; ahm , well let us see ,
the twenty first and the twenty eighth I have seminars on both of those days . &quot; ahm ,
either the seventeenth , or the twenty fourth would be good , &quot; ahm ,
how are those for you .
&quot; ah , I have a seminar on the seventeenth ,
and that will last all day .
how about the twenty fourth in the morning .
alright well ,
as much as I loathe to , get up in the morning , I guess this widget problem really needs some working ,
on , so &quot; ahm ,
yeah ,
what do you say &quot; ah ,
nine o &apos;clock ?
in the morning ?
&quot; ah , that seems too early for me .
how about , let us make it eleven .
and then we will have a working lunch as well .
alright that is great , &quot; ahm , eleven o &apos;clock on the twenty fourth ?
and &quot; ahm , I will see you then , and &quot; ah , good luck working on that improbability drive .
thanks .
I will see you then .
alright then .
&quot; ahm , yeah that is great .
&quot; ahm , let us see here .
I still think we need &quot; ah , to work on the organizational structure of this a bit .
&quot; ahm , do you think we could meet again ?
sometime in June ?
certainly . &quot; ah , I will be on vacation , the , second through the fourth .
and so I will not be able to meet those days .
I am taking the tenth off , as a vacation day . how about , Monday the seventh , or Wednesday the ninth .
&quot; ah , no that is no good for me ,
I am out of town , on the seventh through the ninth .
&quot; ahm , how about Friday the eleventh .
is that okay for you ?
Friday the eleventh is fine if we can do it in the afternoon ,
alright , &quot; ahm , great .
&quot; ahm , so , maybe , like , two o &apos;clock ? in the afternoon ? is that good for you ?
yes , two o &apos;clock will be fine . where would you like to meet ?
&quot; ahm , hm , how would the &quot; ah , Hilton , restaurant do . it is they ,
you know ,
serve some very nice goulash there .
okay , sounds good .
I am not much into goulash , but I could go for a nice juicy steak .
alright then .
&quot; ahm , Friday the eleventh , at two .
at the Hilton .
I will see you then .
bye .
alright then .
&quot; ahm , gee ,
I am sorry about the meeting today . &quot; ah ,
I do not know why ,
Bob did not show up .
but &quot; ahm , I guess we will just have to reschedule it for sometime .
&quot; ahm , gee . my schedule seems to be pretty tight . this month .
&quot; ahm , how is the twenty first for you .
twenty first for me is bad .
I will be out of town , the weekend before , and then the nineteenth twentieth and twenty first . going to the Grand Canyon .
let us see . how about Friday the twenty third . or , Tuesday or Wednesday of the next week .
that would be the twenty seventh or twenty eighth .
&quot; ahm , well the twenty third is okay for me . &quot; ahm ,
as long as our meeting is over before , say one . &quot; ahm ,
and the twenty eighth is all free .
so . either , Friday morning or Wednesday is fine .
I hate morning meetings .
do you mind terribly if we scheduled it for the twenty eighth ? or , would it be better ,
if we did it the twenty third .
how urgent is it .
hm , I do not know . I mean it is government work after all ,
so I guess the twenty eighth is fine . &quot; ahm ,
what do you say to &quot; ah , two ?
on the twenty eighth ? is that okay for you ?
yeah , let the government wait .
two on the twenty eighth is , good for me .
&quot; ah where would you like to meet .
&quot; ahm gee , I do not know .
&quot; ah , we are going to have to , fit , Bob in ,
and &quot; ah , he is pretty picky . &quot; ahm , how about , Fred &apos;s Diner .
that is &quot; ah , down on twelfth street ?
it is &quot; ah Bob really likes out there .
so I guess &quot; ahm ,
we can keep him happy , and maybe he will show up if we have it there . so you think Bob &apos;s ?
or , Fred &apos;s rather ?
Fred &apos;s is fine if we can humor Bob .
I will see you there .
alright , see you .
okay then . &quot; ahm yeah . we should get together sometime to talk about this a bit more .
&quot; ahm geez , &quot; ahm well hey . my schedule for the beginning of next month is , kind of , full .
I am going to be at SIGgraph , on , the third to the sixth . &quot; ahm , how is Friday the thirteenth .
that is a good day for a meeting .
yeah ,
the beginning of this month , is bad for me too .
I am going on vacation with the wife and kids , the first week .
&quot; ahm , Friday the thirteenth .
I am too superstitious to have this important of a meeting then .
how about , let us see . the twenty third , or twenty fifth . do either of those two days suit you ?
which would you prefer ?
hm well I do not know ,
I guess I am going to , be talking to Professor Ginkinspiel &quot; ah , after class on the twenty third .
so maybe the twenty fifth , would be better .
&quot; ahm , say sometime , in the afternoon ?
sure , that is fine with me , pick a time .
&quot; ahm well how about we meet , at &quot; ah , two , down in the conference room downstairs .
is that good for you ?
sure , that is fine for me .
great .
then I will , see you there .
righto , good bye .
I think we need to sit down , for a little while ,
maybe about two hours and , talk about some of these issues ,
&quot; ahm would you have any time next week .
what days look best for you next week .
well ,
every day looks great for me next week , but , not for work . &quot; ah I am going to be on vacation all of next week and the following week ,
I guess the earliest day that I would have , available , &quot; ahm would be ,
the eighteenth ,
on Tuesday .
are you available at all in the afternoon on the eighteenth ?
&quot; ah I get out of class at twelve ,
I could eat lunch , and , maybe , be together by one o &apos;clock or so ,
well , I have a class starting at two .
so , if you wanted to do it , over lunch , then that would be possible for me ,
sure . sounds like a plan .
meet you at , twelve o &apos;clock , &quot; ah for lunch , on Tuesday , the eighteenth .
see you there .
okay great .
do you want to meet at your office then ?
sure .
alright , see you then .
what do you say we get together for a couple of hours . and , &quot; ah have a meeting ,
&quot; ahm how does next week look for you . &quot; ah &quot; ah later on in the week .
Thursday or Friday .
well , I am going to be gone , the tenth .
&quot; ah the eleventh , on Friday , I could do something in the afternoon ,
well , I am free all day Friday , &quot; ah what time would be most convenient for you .
well , my seminar goes until twelve . and it would be nice to have some time for lunch .
what about two , $ P- $ M .
would that be alright ?
sure . fine by me , &quot; ahm two o &apos;clock then , in my office ?
alright great . and that is Friday the eleventh . I will see you then .
what do you say we get together for a meeting . for a couple of hours . and , &quot; ah talk about these things .
&quot; ahm next week , &quot; ah my schedule is looking , pretty good , &quot; ah are you available at all next week ?
well , next week does not look too good for me .
I have got time tomorrow or Wednesday though , are you available then ?
no , I have got a seminar all day tomorrow , and then vacation Wednesday .
&quot; ahm how about Wednesday of next week . do you have any time at all ?
I am free all day ,
no , I am going to be , away from the nineteenth until the twenty first .
&quot; ahm I suppose , Thursday of next week I could do it , sometime in the afternoon ,
I have got meetings in the afternoon .
both Thursday and Friday , of next week .
twenty second and twenty third ,
how about the morning of , the twenty third .
are you available at all ?
yeah .
that would work fine with me .
how about ten o &apos;clock .
sounds great , I will see you then .
alright .
see you then .
no , I am going to be on vacation .
I could do it on the following Monday on the ninth ,
at , one $ P- $ M ?
sure .
that would be fine with me ,
alrighty . well I get out of class at one ,
so ,
give me about a half hour or so . and maybe we can get together , for one thirty in the afternoon then .
I will see you then ,
okay .
do you want to meet in my office ? or yours .
whichever is more convenient for you . does not matter to me ,
okay , why do not you walk over to my office after your class ,
sounds good .
I will see you on the ninth then .
okay .
one thirty on the ninth .
&quot; ah you know what ?
I need to get together with you ,
in a meeting ,
&quot; ah about two hours long .
would you have any time ,
perhaps this afternoon ?
well , since we are just finishing up this meeting .
I think we would be better if we had some time , &quot; ah in between ,
how about sometime next week .
would that be possible ?
&quot; ahm well , I am out of town , Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday .
&quot; ahm Monday and Friday , I might be able to squeeze something in , how does your schedule look .
I could do Monday , from , noon until two ,
shoot . I am booked . &quot; ah noon until two , &quot; ahm but , you are not available after two Monday ?
no , I have got a meeting that starts in two , and goes until four .
alrighty . &quot; ahm how about next Tuesday , are you busy there .
Tuesday , the ninth ? or the sixteenth .
&quot; ah the sixteenth .
how about , the afternoon of the sixteenth .
are you free ?
yeah , I can do that , I get out of my class at noon .
so if I had about an hour for lunch , one o &apos;clock would be fine with me ,
terrific , I get out of class at noon as well . &quot; ahm one o &apos;clock then ?
Tuesday the sixteenth ? we can , meet for a couple of hours and , &quot; ah discuss the issues ?
great .
that sounds good to me .
I will see you then .
see you then .
I think we need to get together , for a couple of hours ,
&quot; ahm later on this week if it is possible with you .
&quot; ahm what does your schedule look like for Friday .
I am going to be busy all day Friday ,
I have a seminar on Thursday and Friday that goes from eight in the morning until five in the afternoon ,
okay then , &quot; ah what day looks best for you next week .
well , I am going to be on vacation , the twelfth and the thirteenth .
&quot; ahm the , fourteenth , Wednesday , I have , late morning , or , anytime in the afternoon ,
how about if we get together , &quot; ah the morning of the fourteenth then .
&quot; ah what time is convenient for you .
I will be getting back from a doctor appointment , at , ten $ A- $ M ,
so sometime , I guess like ten thirty would be good for me ,
hm , terrific .
I will see you then .
alright , when are you free for another meeting .
well &quot; ah ,
I am on vacation from the second to fifteenth ,
so &quot; ah the &quot; ah early part of the month is pretty bad ,
how about &quot; ahm , the nineteenth , in the afternoon ?
Wednesday ?
&quot; ah the nineteenth is really bad .
I have a meeting in the afternoon . but the twentieth is good , I am free all day .
how does that , look for you .
&quot; ahm Thursday the twentieth ,
I have got a meeting from nine , to eleven , in the morning ,
so how about sometime in the afternoon .
sounds fine . eleven o &apos;clock , &quot; ah on , is good for me .
okay , then I will , see you .
alright , for another meeting , &quot; ah if we could get together Friday , that would be great for me .
I am on vacation , the second to the fourth ,
&quot; ahm how about sometime , next week ,
I am &quot; ah , free Monday and Wednesday all day .
I am going to be out of town , from Monday , through Wednesday .
but &quot; ah , the later in the week ,
on Thursday and Friday ,
I have both afternoons free , after eleven , so &quot; ahm , that would be good for me .
I am &quot; ah , off Thursday the tenth ,
but Friday , after &quot; ah twelve would be good . &quot; ah what time is good for you ?
twelve o &apos;clock is fine . &quot; ah I will see you then if it is okay with you ,
okay , bye .
alright ,
this week is really bad for me to get together again , but &quot; ahm , I am going to be free , &quot; ah again on the twenty first ,
&quot; ah that Wednesday ,
all day ,
so ,
what time would be good for you ,
well &quot; ahm the , day that I am free the most , is probably Friday , the twenty third .
I am free all day .
is &quot; ah , that okay with you ?
I have a meeting that afternoon . but &quot; ah , the morning would be great . &quot; ah around nine or ten o &apos;clock .
we can go until around two .
nine o &apos;clock sounds pretty good .
&quot; ahm okay , bye .
alright , I can have another meeting &quot; ah on Monday the second , after one o &apos;clock .
&quot; ahm I am free then , the rest of the week is really bad though ,
I have a conference ,
but &quot; ahm Monday looks pretty good .
well &quot; ah , I am on vacation again , from the second to the sixth , so that is no good .
I am , free , most of the week , from the ninth to the thirteenth , how is then ,
I have the thirteenth open all day , so &quot; ah , that would be , fine for me .
thirteenth I have a , class , from eleven thirty to one , sometime in the afternoon , like maybe two , until five ?
how is then .
that is fine .
as I said , I have the whole day off , so , that is no problem for me .
okay I will , see you then , bye .
okay , we really have to schedule another meeting here .
okay , how is &quot; ah , Wednesday the seventeenth for you .
Wednesday is really bad for me .
I have got a seminar until four thirty then . so , we only have half an hour , extra there ,
so it is really bad .
is there any time in the next couple of weeks when you are free ?
the sixteenth would be good for me .
Tuesday the sixteenth . I have a class ,
ending at twelve ,
so I have , five hours , in there , in the afternoon that would be good .
okay how about like &quot; ah , two o &apos;clock in the afternoon . on the sixteenth ,
sounds good to me , that does not seem to be like a problem I have any problems with that ,
okay great ,
okay .
it is Monday the fifth now ,
and we are going to have to get together to meet in the next two weeks or so .
when are you free .
how is &quot; ah , Friday the sixteenth .
I am &quot; ah free all day then ,
actually that is really bad for me .
I have got to leave around four o &apos;clock .
so I really do not have that much time .
&quot; ah but that Monday the fifth actually is good ,
later today , I have twelve to four free ,
I have got a meeting from &quot; ah , two to four today , so today is not good .
how about &quot; ahm , the nineteenth ?
I am &quot; ah , free all day , or the twentieth I am , free from morning until two $ P- $ M ,
&quot; ah twentieth sounds great , do not have anything to do ,
how about maybe like &quot; ah ten in the morning ?
sounds fine to me ,
okay I will see you then , bye .
hi . do you have any openings next Thursday ?
next Thursday .
no , I am afraid I am going to be , &quot; ah vacationing in the Bahamas , for the next two weeks .
hm bummer .
&quot; ahm what about the next week .
after that . I am , pretty busy , most the week , but Monday , I am okay .
are you going to be back from your vacation by then ?
&quot; ah I will be back from my vacation by then , but I have got a seminar , &quot; ah all day .
&quot; ahm the earliest , I believe , I could see you , is the morning of the eighteenth .
&quot; ah it is just the morning free then on the eighteenth ?
&quot; ah yes , unfortunately .
I have got a class , &quot; ah in the afternoon .
&quot; ahm the , afternoon , of , Wednesday or Thursday , &quot; ah anytime after noon would be fine ,
okay ,
I have got a meeting , all day Wednesday ,
but I am , free all day Thursday ,
so , let us meet like ,
three o &apos;clock . on Thursday , afternoon .
okay . Thursday the twentieth of May , at three o &apos;clock .
I will see you there , bye bye ,
hi .
are you at all , free on , any Friday , in June ?
well the ,
first Friday , I will be on vacation . and every Friday after that I have a seminar in the morning ,
&quot; ah if you are free in the afternoon ,
I could make plans for then .
yes . that would be fine , how about the eleventh .
the eleventh , would be okay ,
&quot; ah let us make it for , two o &apos;clock .
because I would like some time to have lunch after the seminar .
maybe we could meet for lunch .
I know a good little Chinese restaurant downtown ,
hm Chinese does not agree with me , &quot; ah but there is an Italian place I know .
let us meet there at one o &apos;clock .
okay .
sounds good to me .
&quot; ahm I will meet you after the seminar .
agreed .
I will see you then ,
hi .
are you open , the week of the twenty sixth ,
&quot; ah yes . it looks like I have got some free time then , how is , &quot; ah Tuesday or Wednesday .

alright .
let us make that an early meeting .
&quot; ah how about , nine o &apos;clock .
hey .

&quot; ah sure .
I will be , out of town , on Thursday the twenty sixth ,
and , &quot; ah I have a class on the twenty seventh ,
how about , Wednesday the twenty fifth .
sounds good , how about noon .
well ,
Wednesdays are kind of , slow days for me .
how about we make it , &quot; ah one o &apos;clock ,
just to make sure I am in , good form .
okay .
one o &apos;clock then . see you ,
&quot; ah I would like to make an appointment sometime next week , preferably , Monday or Tuesday ,
&quot; ah Monday is pretty busy here . and , &quot; ah Tuesday , &quot; ah I am occupied , &quot; ah between nine and twelve with a class .
okay .
I am not going to be able to , &quot; ah come up , on Wednesday or Thursday . are you going to be in Friday .
&quot; ahm I have , got classes , and meetings , but , &quot; ah that is the earliest I will be able to get there .
no . I am afraid Friday , I have a seminar all day .
&quot; ahm is it , vitally necessary that it be , &quot; ah this upcoming week ?
no , I guess not how is your schedule the week of the fifteenth .
&quot; ah well , I am completely free on Wednesday the seventeenth .
well ,
I am going to be busy all day then ,
except for the evening ,
and , well ,
I can not do evenings ,
you know ,
wife and kids and everything .
okay . &quot; ah how about , the afternoon , of the sixteenth then .
that sounds good , how about , one thirty .
excellent .
I will see you at one thirty then .
thanks , bye .
hello . do you have any time , that you could meet with me , &quot; ahm on the week of the twelfth ?
well let me take a look .
&quot; ah the , Monday and Tuesday , the twelfth and the thirteenth , I have vacation &quot; ahm how about , Friday the sixteenth .
I am , free all day .
okay . I have got to , be home at four , on Friday , so how about sometime around noon .
noon would be fine here .
we will be out , of here by four .
so , &quot; ah we will make it Friday the sixteenth then .
okay , I will see you then ,
&quot; ah hi Sam , &quot; ahm ,
this is Lysander again . &quot; ahm ,
I was just wondering ,
after the meeting I had forgotten to &quot; ah schedule a meeting with you for this month , &quot; ahm ,
what would be a good time for you , to meet for a couple of hours , during the month of March , &quot; ahm ,
right now I would suggest maybe the sixteenth or , the , &quot; ah or the twenty second around one o &apos;clock .
that would be great . &quot; ah &quot; ahm what do you think .
okay ,
the sixteen in the afternoon is looking okay ,
or , the afternoon of the twenty second is also okay . which day would you prefer .
I think the sixteenth would do best because we have to get this done as soon as possible . &quot; ahm ,
what we have to talk about at the meeting .
&quot; ahm , alright ,
one o &apos;clock on , the sixteenth that is a Tuesday ?
is that official ?
yeah ,
hello Sam , &quot; ahm ,
I know we just got out of the meeting but I had forgotten to &quot; ah find out &quot; ah what would be a good time to meet again , with you . &quot; ahm ,
all we need is a couple hours to talk about , a few things ? &quot; ahm ,
right now , it is looking like ,
next Monday the twelfth would be a good idea at around , maybe , ten or eleven in the morning .
what would be good for you .
I am sorry but it will be impossible for me to make a meeting on the twelfth , &quot; ah ,
I am going on vacation for , the twelfth and thirteenth .
&quot; ah Friday the sixteenth looks good or Monday the nineteenth if either of those two days suit you .
well I usually try to keep business &quot; ah out of Fridays but &quot; ahm so Monday the nineteenth would be very good for me . &quot; ahm ,
how is about , &quot; ahm , one o &apos;clock . right after lunch .
that would be great .
what about you .
yeah that sounds pretty good on this end , &quot; ah , well , where would you like to meet .
yeah I will meet you in Warner Hall if that is okay with you . &quot; ah you say your office is on the third floor .
what number would that be ?
my office is third floor three one four , &quot; ahm it says three one four in the door , &quot; ahm ,
just tell my secretary &quot; ahm ,
that your name is Sam and she will send you right in .
thanks a lot .
okay , thank you .
hi , &quot; ah looking at my schedule , I am free , &quot; ah every Monday , after the third .
that would be either the tenth , the seventeenth , the twenty fourth , or the thirty first .
would , &quot; ah any of those days be good for you ?
&quot; ahm the third and ,
well ,
between the second , and the fifteenth I am going to be on a vacation ,
but I am free on the , twenty fourth , &quot; ahm anytime before four ,
since I have a doctor &apos;s appointment at four .
okay ,
&quot; ah on the twenty fourth ,
if we could set something up , &quot; ah before noon .
possibly , &quot; ah from ten o &apos;clock to , &quot; ah twelve o &apos;clock , &quot; ah on the twenty fourth ?
would that be alright ?
that will be fine by me , &quot; ah I guess I will see you then ,
&quot; ah yeah ,
I am free , &quot; ah the Fridays , all the Fridays in June ,
if we would , like to meet then .
but , &quot; ah if you would like to meet early ,
I could meet you on Thursday , &quot; ah after ,
in the afternoon , before five .
&quot; ah any time would be good . on those dates .
well I have a seminar , on , Friday , the eleventh ,
&quot; ah from nine until twelve , but we could have it right after seminar . &quot; ahm let us say for lunch again ,
from ,
I do not know ,
twelve until , two ?
okay ,
&quot; ah so that is Friday the eleventh ,
&quot; ah let me put this down , as from twelve o &apos;clock , until two o &apos;clock in the afternoon we will be , &quot; ah meeting for ?
sounds good .
okay , I will see you then ,
my schedule is pretty jammed up until the , &quot; ah the twenty first .
I am free that day .
&quot; ah so I could meet possibly , all day , that day . or , &quot; ah the twenty second or twenty third in the mornings .
&quot; ah do any of those dates seem , &quot; ah satisfying to you ?
thanks .
&quot; ahm I am going to be , out of town on the twenty first ,
and , on the twenty second I have got a meeting all morning ,
but the twenty third I am going to be free , &quot; ah how about , a breakfast meeting , from ,
let us say ,

I am free all day . on the twenty fifth , I am free from twelve to four .

&quot; ah great .
I am looking forward to it .

hi . Ian .
I would like to talk to you about ,
I need to talk to you for two more hours .

what time are you free this month .

from nine to twelve .
but I am free on a lot of afternoons .
well ,
this Monday would be great then ,
&quot; ah at two o &apos;clock ,
I am free for , at least two hours .
but unfortunately , I will be out of town , on Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday . and , Friday looks like a bad time .
after twelve o &apos;clock .
yeah .
I happen to have a meeting this Monday .
from two to four .
so , &quot; ah this , next week is out .
are you free on , maybe the seventeenth or the sixteenth ?
&quot; ah well , the sixteenth would be fine , I am free from twelve o &apos;clock until five o &apos;clock ,

okay , sounds good to me .
I will see you then .
yeah , I will see you there also .
hi . Ian ? &quot; ah is there , any chance I can talk to you for two more hours sometime this month ,
I am not free , until , possibly the twelfth ?
after , sometime between nine and four ?
I am going on a four day weekend . from the tenth to the thirteenth so , the twelfth is out .
maybe that Friday are you free ?
or perhaps , the fifteenth ?
on the fifteenth , I will be busy all day ,
but , &quot; ah on Friday the sixteenth ,
I am free until four o &apos;clock $ P- $ M .
&quot; ah great .
could you , we maybe meet together at say , ten to twelve , on the sixteenth then ?
&quot; ah sounds good to me , then .
okay , then I will see you there ,
okay , bye .
hi Ian it is Nick again &quot; ah , we need to meet sometime in May . &quot; ah , the sooner the better .
I am free all day on the sixth , and looks like I am free in the afternoon on the third .
I am sorry both those days are out for me I am , going on vacation from the second to the fifteenth .
&quot; ahm , anytime , the week after that I , might be able to squeeze you in ,
the twenty first is , clear for sure though .
well the twenty first is pretty bad for me but &quot; ah the seventeenth and the twentieth I am free all day . &quot; ahm ,
and &quot; ah , from noon to four on the eighteenth , I am free ,
and then on the nineteenth I am free in the morning .
&quot; ah let us go for a meeting on the twentieth then . since I have , classes during the rest of the , week .
&quot; ahm let us try &quot; ah for say two o &apos;clock ?
yep .
two o &apos;clock on the twentieth .
I will see you then .
well I am taking the rest of this week off .
but &quot; ah , Fridays are pretty good .
&quot; ahm , could you meet on the eleventh at say two o &apos;clock ?
could we make it any earlier on that &quot; ah Friday .
I usually like to leave early on Fridays .
well I have got a seminar from nine to twelve .
&quot; ahm I could meet you at twelve thirty and we could &quot; ah , have this meeting over lunch though if you want .
yeah twelve thirty is fine , on the eleventh .
so I will see you then .
bye .
okay I will see you then .
hi &quot; ah , we need to schedule a meeting .
&quot; ah today is the twelfth .
&quot; ah I am on vacation until the , &quot; ah nineteenth .
&quot; ahm and my schedule is not going to be free until about the twenty first .
&quot; ahm then I am free on the twenty second and twenty third in the mornings . so let me know what is good for you .
&quot; ah I am free all day on the twenty third .
so &quot; ah , you can just pick a time and &quot; ah , it will probably be pretty good for me .
&quot; ahm on the twenty third I have a meeting at two in the afternoon .
&quot; ahm , so maybe we could do it in the morning .
say &quot; ah ten $ A- $ M ?
okay that sounds great .
then I will &quot; ah meet you at your office .
hi &quot; ah we need to schedule a meeting again .
&quot; ahm I am free Monday after two .
but it looks like next week , I am going to be really busy , &quot; ah , the rest of the week .
&quot; ahm , so if anything on Monday is good for you let me know .
yeah I am going on vacation this week .
&quot; ah could we meet on Monday sixteenth then at &quot; ah , say three o &apos;clock ?
I was hoping to meet sooner &quot; ahm , maybe we could meet on the thirteenth .
are you busy that day ?
&quot; ahm otherwise the sixteenth is okay with me .
I could meet at nine in the morning on the thirteenth or &quot; ah after about one thirty .
but &quot; ahm between then I have a class . so if those times are free for you the , thirteenth would be great .
&quot; ahm yeah nine $ A- $ M on the thirteenth sounds fine .
I will see you then .
okay then , at nine $ A- $ M it is .
&quot; ah I am looking forward to it .
hi Ian this is Nick .
&quot; ah we need to schedule a meeting , &quot; ahm , so if you could let me know what time is good for you ,
&quot; ah next week is a little bit busy but on the seventeenth I am free all day .
well actually I am going to be out of town next week also .
&quot; ahm but the seventeenth is going to be looking pretty bad for me because I am going to be in a seminar all day . &quot; ahm ,
probably &quot; ahm if it could be sooner ,
that would be better probably the eighth , of March &quot; ah looks good for me , &quot; ah , after two $ P- $ M in the afternoon . &quot; ah ,
if you , really can not do it next week then ,
I guess we will have to talk about the week after .
&quot; ahm , on the eighth I have a meeting from two to four .
I could do it on the afternoon of , the , ninth .
but &quot; ah , next week is really not , that well for me .
okay well I guess that next week is out of the question . but &quot; ah ,
we could do it the &quot; ahm , the sixteenth in the afternoon , or the &quot; ah , nineteenth in the afternoon .
&quot; ahm , sixteenth after twelve or the nineteenth after two . &quot; ah is good for me .
the sixteenth is good .
shall we say meet &quot; ah , about two o &apos;clock ?
&quot; ahm two o &apos;clock is perfect . &quot; ah I will meet you at &quot; ah , the place we talked about earlier .
two o &apos;clock on the sixteenth .
see you then .
okay yeah .
I will see you there then .
hi Ian this is Nick again .
&quot; ah we need to schedule a meeting ,
probably &quot; ah , anytime after Wednesday I will be in in town .
&quot; ah , so ,
if you &quot; ah , have a good time then &quot; ah that would be great with me .
thanks ,
I have got seminars from eight to five on both &quot; ah Thursday and Friday ,
and I am going on vacation on the twelfth and thirteenth .
&quot; ahm could we meet on the afternoon of the fourteenth ?
or maybe the afternoon of the fifteenth ?
actually the &quot; ah fourteenth and fifteenth are &quot; ah pretty bad for me .
&quot; ahm , maybe we could make it for the week after that .
the twentieth and twenty first I am completely , &quot; ah free .
and the nineteenth I am free until four o &apos;clock ,
&quot; ah so those three days ,
&quot; ah if any of those are good for you ,
&quot; ahm that would be a perfect time for me .
great . why do not we meet at one o &apos;clock on the nineteenth .
&quot; ah , that would be great for me .
&quot; ah yeah that works .
I will see you on the nineteenth .
okay , sounds good .
well it will be impossible for me to make a meeting , in the next two weeks as I am going on vacation to Cancun .
&quot; ahm , how about say the end of the following week .
the twenty first ?
would that Friday suit you ?
oh . sorry &quot; ahm ,
that will not be possible &quot; ah , I have a seminar to attend on that day from , eight to five .
so we will have to , schedule for another day ,
when else are you free .
well let us see .
I could have a meeting on , Wednesday the twenty sixth in the afternoon if that would be good for you .
afternoon meetings are the best for me .
if not the twenty sixth the twenty seventh or twenty eighth might also work .
&quot; ah &quot; ahm on the twenty sixth &quot; ahm ,
anytime between twelve and two .
is fine with me &quot; ahm ,
&quot; ah I have to be somewhere between two and six .
&quot; ahm , on the twenty seventh , &quot; ahm I can meet you between nine and ten , and anytime , after like ten thirty .
what happened there .
the system has stopped .
well the twenty seventh in the afternoon seems like a good choice to me .
&quot; ah how about two o &apos;clock .
&quot; ahm , two is perfect for me &quot; ahm , I do not know &quot; ah exactly how long , will you be available .
anytime from two anyway .
&quot; ah I mean do you have any commitments , shortly after two because I would like to meet with you for a while .
nope .
&quot; ah I have no commitments , after two o &apos;clock ,
so we should be able to meet until five or , even go out for dinner afterwards .
if you would like .
okay .
two o &apos;clock then &quot; ahm , so I will see you on the twenty seventh .
&quot; ahm , alright .
take care . cheers .
&quot; ahm hi , &quot; ahm I want to find out when we can meet anytime , &quot; ahm , soon . this month .
&quot; ahm &quot; ah &quot; ahm anytime during the week , will be fine with me . &quot; ahm when are you free .
I will be on vacation , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday . &quot; ah how about the seventh or the ninth .
either of those two days suit me .
&quot; ah no , that will not be possible .
I will not be in town , &quot; ahm on the seventh . I have to go to Philadelphia .
&quot; ahm I will be back , late on the ninth anyway .
so ,
I mean the earliest I can meet you , is on the tenth .
and , &quot; ahm on the tenth , eleven is fine with me . &quot; ahm what about you .
&quot; ah I am sorry , the tenth is impossible for me , I am , taking the day off then going to Kennywood .
&quot; ah how about the fourteenth or the seventeenth . do either of those two days , fit into your schedule ?
&quot; ah &quot; ah fourteenth is , perfect for me ,
&quot; ahm I do not have anything due , and , &quot; ahm so anytime between nine and five obviously is fine .
on the seventeenth though , &quot; ahm I have conference . &quot; ah between nine $ A- $ M and eleven $ A- $ M .
so , basically , you know , I have conferences weekly . &quot; ah the third , tenth , seventeenth , and twenty fourth .
so ,
&quot; ahm if we choose to meet on the seventeenth ,
it has to be after , eleven . but the fourteenth seems to be , perfect .
great then .
let us schedule it for the fourteenth .
do you prefer morning ? or afternoon meetings .
I prefer afternoon myself .
no ,
I would rather we meet in the morning . &quot; ahm because usually my secretary is , &quot; ahm fond of scheduling ,
impromptu meetings in the afternoons for me .
so , &quot; ahm I think we should meet in the morning .
any time between nine and twelve is fine with me .
when is fine with you .
well then how about we have a working lunch .
say ,
we meet around , ten thirty or eleven o &apos;clock ?
and , then we will go to lunch afterwards .
alright , that is cool with me .
&quot; ahm I can meet you ,
&quot; ahm let us meet at eleven . and , &quot; ahm so , max by one , or , one thirty we should be through .
&quot; ahm so I will see you then .
okay , very good .
I am looking forward to meeting with you .
&quot; ah hi , &quot; ahm I have called to find out ,
&quot; ahm when , we could meet .
anytime , this month ,
&quot; ahm &quot; ah it is , highly crucial that we meet and , &quot; ahm preferably this week is fine with me .
&quot; ahm when exactly are you going to be available .
well , okay .
on my schedule it is looking like the thirteenth , or fourteenth , is fine , or . the fifteenth in the afternoon would suit .
&quot; ah do either of those three days suit you ?
no .
effectively the thirteenth is out of the question .
&quot; ahm I have to be somewhere between nine and four . and , between four and five I reckon I will be , exhausted .
&quot; ahm between the fourteenth and the nineteenth , is also out of the question .
&quot; ahm I will not be in town . &quot; ahm I am going skiing in Denver .
so , &quot; ahm I do not know any time , the twentieth . &quot; ah is also out of the question .
&quot; ahm so the , earliest we can meet is on the twenty first . &quot; ahm what about you .
well , &quot; ah the nineteenth through twenty first is also out for me because I am taking an extended weekend there and ,
we are going , &quot; ah out to see the Grand Canyon .
&quot; ah how about the twenty , seventh , or twenty eighth .
that would be a Tuesday or a Wednesday . &quot; ah any time those days suit me .
are either of those two days good for you ?
no , twenty seventh is out as well .
&quot; ahm I have a seminar to attend and , it ends , you know , &quot; ah very late .
so . twenty eighth would be fine . &quot; ahm anytime , you know , in the afternoon on the twenty eighth .
I actually have nothing then but I prefer to schedule my appointments for the afternoon . so ,
&quot; ahm &quot; ah what do you say we meet , lunch time on the twenty eighth .
okay , lunch time on the twenty eighth sounds good to me . &quot; ah where would you like to meet .
okay , there is this , &quot; ahm restaurant , &quot; ahm called Diminitello &apos;s .
it is on Shady Avenue . &quot; ah we could meet there at one , on the twenty eighth .
&quot; ah it is really a very nice restaurant anyway .
or if you have any in mind . but this is my favorite , eating spot .
okay , well that is fine with me , but , &quot; ah you just said , you would , like to meet at one .
previously you had said twelve . &quot; ah which time would you like to meet .
&quot; ahm right . &quot; ahm I mean like if we are to meet somewhere . &quot; ah I would rather we meet at one .
but if I was meeting in your office or whatever ,
&quot; ahm I mean like anytime from twelve I can be free but . I mean just to give , each of us time ,
like if we are actually going to meet somewhere in town .
so ,
&quot; ah if it is going to be the restaurant ,
one o &apos;clock is fine with me , &quot; ahm what do you say .
great . then one o &apos;clock it is . I will see you there .
&quot; ahm hi I called to find out &quot; ahm , when I could set up an appointment with you .
anytime this month . but preferably , &quot; ahm , in the next two weeks .
&quot; ahm , when exactly , would you be available .
no , those days are quite messy for me .
&quot; ahm , Monday is out because I , you know like I will be free from one though ,
but I will be exhausted and &quot; ahm , you know there will not be enough time . &quot; ahm Wednesday is also out .
I will be out throughout the day . so is Tuesday .
so is , effectively Thursday . which means that the earliest , day . is Friday . the thirteenth .
&quot; ahm how does that sound .
I suppose Friday the thirteenth could be acceptable , though that seems like a bad day for a meeting .
&quot; ahm , how about Monday the sixteenth or Thursday the nineteenth .
that would be the following week .
&quot; ahm Monday is bad for me .
Thursday I actually do not have anything doing .
but &quot; ahm , a friend of mine hm &quot; ahm ,
called , some time ago and and said that he might be coming over on the nineteenth .
&quot; ahm , so that day might be bad for me .
it is not bad right now but I do not want to take the risk .
&quot; ahm , twentieth is a Friday .
&quot; ah &quot; ah &quot; ah we probably do not schedule anything for that day . what about , Tuesday the following week .
the twenty fourth .
well I have a conference in the afternoon on the fourth and I was counting on being able to sleep in .
&quot; ah how about the twenty fifth .
or the thirtieth .
no . twenty fifth is &quot; ah , is out for me .
that is my girlfriend &apos;s birthday . &quot; ahm , and I really do not know I might actually take the day , off . or she might come over for a while I &quot; ah actually do not know what ,
will happen .
the thirtieth is also out effectively .
Mondays are out . more or less .
so &quot; ahm ,
we could meet on the twenty sixth or the twenty seventh .
so &quot; ahm ,
or the last day of the month the thirty first . or preferably the twenty sixth then .
that looks perfect to me .
what about you .
yeah I do not blame you for taking off your girlfriend &apos;s birthday I do the same thing . &quot; ah ,
the twenty sixth is out of the question because I will be out of town ,
&quot; ah let us go back to the twenty fourth .
&quot; ah I guess I could make a morning meeting there if it would suit you .
say around , ten o &apos;clock ?
&quot; ahm yeah . ten , might be tight for me . what about eleven .
why do not we meet at eleven .
&quot; ahm , we can meet anytime between eleven and &quot; ah , one .
so we will just extend it so we will have lunch together .
&quot; ahm how does that sound .
sounds great to me , I will see you then .
I would like to schedule a meeting with you sometime in the near future if that is possible ,
&quot; ah how about the sixth .
or the tenth .
I am going to Cancun with my wife , from the second to the fifteenth .
&quot; ah could we move that back to maybe the , &quot; ah eighteenth ?
or the , nineteenth ?
&quot; ah I am sorry , the eighteenth does not work for me .
I am going with my wife and kids to see a basketball game , how about the , twentieth or the twenty fourth .
sorry .
I am free on the afternoon of the twentieth , and the , &quot; ah morning of the twenty fourth , and , part of the afternoon on the twenty fourth .
&quot; ah , would either of those times work for you .
certainly .
I would suggest the afternoon of the twentieth .
how about , three o &apos;clock .
three o &apos;clock works well for me , &quot; ah I will see you there .
okay . thank you .
I would like to schedule a meeting with you sometime in the near future .
&quot; ah how about , &quot; ah for a Friday .
any Friday this month is looking pretty good on my schedule .
how about yours .
I have seminars , every Friday from , nine to twelve , &quot; ah would afternoons work for you ?
certainly .
any afternoon would be fine .
pick a day .
why do not we meet at two o &apos;clock on , Friday the eleventh . &quot; ah
very good .
Friday at two o &apos;clock . the eleventh .
&quot; ah I will , meet you in your office then . if that is okay ?
sure .
I will see you then .
thank you ,
I would like to schedule a meeting with you sometime .
&quot; ah how about this afternoon .
no , I have a class this afternoon . &quot; ahm tomorrow and , &quot; ah Wednesday are free though .
&quot; ah I would not want you to skip your class , &quot; ahm tomorrow or Wednesday .
no ,
they do not work on my schedule .
&quot; ah I am taking a vacation . let us see , how about the twenty first .
I will be away on business on the twenty first . &quot; ah could the twenty second or the twenty third , work out ?
yes .
&quot; ah how about the morning of the twenty second .
I have a meeting , from , nine to twelve . that morning .
is the afternoon free ?
no , the afternoon is not good for me .
&quot; ah how about the twenty third , in the morning .
let us make it ten o &apos;clock . and go to lunch afterwards .
okay , I will meet you at Hemmingway &apos;s .
Hemmingway &apos;s ?

I will meet you there .
&quot; ah very well .

I would like to schedule a meeting with you , for sometime toward the end of this month .
&quot; ah how does the last week in this month look to you .
I will be out of town on the twenty sixth , but other than then it is pretty free .
how about Wednesday , the twenty fifth . in the afternoon .
that day looks good .
shall we meet around two ?
sounds good to me , where shall we meet ,
&quot; ah I do not know . do you have a preference of a restaurant ?
or shall we meet at , an office .
&quot; ah let us meet at the Lamont restaurant . in Pittsburgh .
okay , I am sure I will be able to find my way there ,
just tell the taxi driver .
he will know where it is .
okay then .
I will see you there .
I really enjoyed our meeting this morning . &quot; ah would you have time in the future ,
for us to schedule another two hour meeting ?
sure , when will you be , available .
well ,
let us see .
today is the fifth . and I will be out of town , and busy next week ,
the next two weeks in fact . how about the twenty third or twenty fifth .
I am free on the afternoon of the twenty third , and the twenty fifth .
&quot; ah which is better for you .
the twenty fifth seems like a better day .
how about two o &apos;clock .
&quot; ah then two o &apos;clock it is . I will meet you in your office .
very good .
I will see you then .
I would like to schedule another meeting with you sometime in the future if that is possible ,
&quot; ah how do the next few weeks look in your schedule .
&quot; ah I am free on the mornings of the sixth ,
eighth , and ninth , and on the , &quot; ah afternoon of the seventh . are you free any of those times ?
no . none of those time work for me .
how about the twentieth or twenty first .
that would be a Tuesday or a Wednesday .
I am free on the morning of the twentieth and the afternoon of the twenty first .
&quot; ah do those times work for you ? at all ?
yes .
the twenty first works the best .
I like afternoon meetings . shall we say , one o &apos;clock ?

and we are going to have to get together again and go over this for &quot; ah at least a couple of hours .
&quot; ahm what is your schedule look like next week .
any , &quot; ahm blocks of two hours you can , free up , for a meeting ?
&quot; ah actually , I am leaving for Hawaii , tomorrow , and I will not be home for two weeks ,
&quot; ah I will not be back until the seventeenth ,
and that day I have a seminar all day ,
so , actually I will not , really be free until the eighteenth ,
so ,
tell me what your schedule looks like , around that week .
okay ,
on Tuesday the eighteenth ,
I have from twelve to four free ,
that is a four hour block . and , &quot; ahm that would work ,
the next day , I have the whole morning free up until two ,
and , Thursday ,
the , day is completely open .
so , afternoon of the eighteenth , morning of the nineteenth , or anytime , Thursday .
okay , I got classes both the eighteenth and the nineteenth .
and then on the twentieth , I am in a meeting from nine to eleven .
but after that I am free the whole day .
and I think we should get together again after lunch ,
if that is alright with you .
alright ,
sounds like a deal .
but , &quot; ahm I got , &quot; ah hepatitis from the food the last time I ate at that coffee shop .
so why do not we meet at Yum Wok , at twelve ,
we can grab a bite to eat , and then , &quot; ah walk back to the office , and , &quot; ah go over this , material . for the month of May .
alright , sounds good to me .
&quot; ah then it is a deal , and , I will meet you there .
alright , well , that apart , hey , that is pretty exciting .
you are going to Hawaii this weekend , huh ?
what did you say two weeks ?
you ever been there before ?
yeah , I have a house right on the beach . and I go there every year . I like it a lot .
hm
you are milking me , how can you afford a house on the beach in Hawaii , while you are a full time student .
any rate , I am , &quot; ah green with envy , and , &quot; ah which island is it on .
&quot; ah it is out on Maui ,
right on the black sand beaches . it is very nice . &quot; ah &quot; ah I will take you there sometime ,
if you want to go .
hm
okay ,
hey , you have a good time ,
and I will take you up on that offer next year , when I have a , three day weekend .
hey , looks like we need to schedule another meeting , &quot; ahm let us see .
it is the end of May ,
&quot; ahm and tomorrow is a Tuesday ,
I have the day off .
&quot; ahm so I do not think I want to do any work , tomorrow . and when I come back I have a seminar all day .
first , block of time I have open is Thursday , the afternoon after eleven .
how are you .
okay .
Tuesday is kind of filled for me .
and I am going back on vacation .
from Wednesday to Friday .
but , it looks like next Monday , I have , totally open ,
if you want to get together then ,
tell me what your schedule is like then .
alright ,
I have got a , &quot; ah little vacation time coming up myself ,
so I will be out of town , &quot; ah all the way through Wednesday , the first ,
day I will have , &quot; ahm time open again will be , next Thursday the tenth .
I have a conference in the morning from nine to eleven . but , &quot; ahm after eleven is open .
okay ,
Thursday is my day off .
and I just want to relax .
because I do not want to have to worry about work .
&quot; ah Friday , I have , a seminar from nine to twelve .
and then after that I am free for the rest of the day ,
if that is alright with you , and then also , next Monday I have off .
totally the whole day .
&quot; ah we can do it then ,
okay ,
that Friday , I do not have anything on my calendar , and I do have Monday open too ,
so I think I will reserve Friday to get out of here a little early . and , &quot; ahm stretch my weekend a little bit ,
but I could meet you Monday morning , how does nine o &apos;clock sound .
okay .
nine o &apos;clock is fine with me .
&quot; ah you want to meet at the Yum Wok again ?
no ,
I will still be in coffee mode . that early in the morning , &quot; ahm if it is convenient for you , can you just come up to my office ?
yeah , it is fine if I come to your office .
but I am not really sure where it is ,
so you will have to give me , just like slight directions , how to get there .
well okay , you just , &quot; ahm come in the main lobby entrance , there is a bank of elevators on your right .
&quot; ahm do not get in the first or second elevator ,
because they only go to the eleventh floor .
&quot; ahm any of the elevators after that will take you up to the thirteenth floor ,
where my office is .
&quot; ahm any of the elevators that you get off of , you just turn left , go to the end of the hallway ,
turn right , and it is the first door on your left .
okay .
that should not be too hard to find .
I guess I will meet you there at nine o &apos;clock .
okay , looks like we ran over time on this meeting again ,
so ,
&quot; ahm looks like we are going to have to schedule another , two hour block ,
&quot; ahm to go over this business , &quot; ahm and I am kind of , curious to see what your office is like ,
let us see if we can , &quot; ah hook up there ,
and , &quot; ahm unless you are free tomorrow .
no ,
never mind .
belay that .
&quot; ahm this whole week is bad . what does your schedule look like next week .
okay ,
I have an out of town business meeting in new York next week .
until Wednesday .
and then the rest of ,
Thursday and Friday I have a lot of time .
on Thursday , I get off at twelve , from a meeting , alright ,
we could meet then , or on Friday ,
I am , &quot; ahm open the whole day .
so , tell me what your days are like then .
okay ,
if for any reason you , &quot; ah really want to get together by Thursday ,
I could meet you then ,
I have , &quot; ahm the morning free ,
which would give us , &quot; ah from basically twelve to two ,
where we both have off .
I , however though , would prefer ,
to meet on Friday ,
if it works , okay for you ,
because , &quot; ahm I have the whole morning until two in the afternoon free ,
how does that sound .
okay , Friday morning is fine with me .
I say , if we meet around ten in my office , I think we can get a lot done then .
okay .
sounds good .
but ,
&quot; ahm like I said ,
I have not been over , to your place , before ,
so , if you can give me directions .
I would appreciate it .
okay ,
it is down the road from your , office . and you go in the main lobby ,
and then you take the ,
it is like a gold elevator , and you go up to the top floor , and , when get off ,
you will just see ,
it is like a big penthouse , and , my desk is at the back .
and you will see me , there .
and we can eat breakfast , or whatever you want . and talk about it then .
I have a Compaq , it is &quot; ah $ I $ B $ M compatible . but that should do , just fine ,
&quot; ahm I guess , yeah but bring the disk over . and we will discuss it then .
well ,
looks like , &quot; ah we are faced with our , monthly scheduling problem ,
&quot; ahm it is the end of July , and next week is horrible for me , &quot; ahm unless you can meet me Monday afternoon .
I am free after Monday afternoon , I am , out of town at a conference the whole rest of the week .
okay ,
I am going back to my house in Hawaii this week .
so , I will not be able to get back together , until , Monday the ninth ,
I have all day free .
actually that whole week . is pretty good ,
I do not have much to do .
&quot; ah tell me what your schedule is like , the week of the ninth .
well ,
I will tell you what .
I have a class , from eight $ A- $ M to one $ P- $ M .
and , &quot; ah I have a suggestion .
all that data , we usually review , &quot; ahm has been , put together by my secretary , on a , real easy to present , spreadsheet graphic format ,
and , &quot; ahm I think we should meet at the links .
why do not we go play eighteen holes ,
and ,
&quot; ahm what we will do is , &quot; ah we will get a golf cart ,
and I will bring the paperwork with me ,
and we can go over it between holes , how does that sound .
alright , it sounds good to me .
I have not played golf in a while . and might be a little rusty .
but , I will get my clubs out the closet and ,
well what time do you want to meet over there ?
well my class gets out at one .
and , I am going to have to go home and get changed . that is a half hour trip each way . and ,
&quot; ah I do not want to rush myself .
so let us make it , &quot; ahm two thirty , how does that sound for you .
okay ,
two thirty ,
we should be able to get a good eighteen holes in . and still go over our work . &quot; ah just bring everything .
bring all the data that you have , &quot; ah brought before ,
and , I will meet you then .
okay .
&quot; ahm let us just meet in front of the club house ,
and ,
&quot; ahm that sounds like a good plan , I will talk to you then , you have a good afternoon .
okay , I am talking now .
hey ,
&quot; ahm meeting is over ,
I got to run ,
but we have to talk about this further .
so ,
sometime in the next couple of weeks ,
can we hook up and , &quot; ah go over this again ?
yeah , it is fine with me ,
if we get back together ,
to talk about this ,
I have plenty of time over the next two weeks to talk ,
&quot; ah what times do you have open .
like , when do you , normally have classes or , meetings .
okay , today is the fifth , right ?
and , &quot; ahm let me take a look at my calendar . but , it is the fifth , right ?
yeah .
today is the fifth , I think it is around , twelve thirty . right now .
what does the rest of your afternoon look like today .
&quot; ah I am free for the rest of the day . I had a three hour meeting this morning ,
but now I am done .
I am just going to go home .
well ,
I guess we could , hook up for two hours this afternoon , because I see down in the notes here it says today is Friday the fifth at noon ,
but , I guess we will go and , &quot; ahm figure out another time we can meet too .
any rate , I am out of town , Tuesday through Wednesday of next week .
on Monday , I am free , from ,
&quot; ah let us see ,
what is the earliest , you can meet .
I am free in the morning , Monday , how are you .
okay ,
I can not meet tonight , because I am going out ,
and I have to get ready .
so ,
about next week ,
&quot; ah Monday , I have meetings in the day ,
from ten to eleven ,
and then ,
but I am free from eleven to , two .
if you want to get together in there .
and then , after that , I am not free again until four o &apos;clock on Monday .
okay , what time does the work day start in this scenario .
because , &quot; ahm I have , a meeting that starts at nine $ A- $ M , on Monday .
so there is seven to nine a possibility .
that is probably too early for this scenario .
I am out of town , Tuesday through Thursday like I said ,
Friday , I have free , from , eleven to one ,
if that would work for you ?
okay ,
&quot; ahm I think the earliest we can start is nine o &apos;clock . because I saw ,
like nothing starts before nine on the whole thing .
and , &quot; ah and then Tuesday through Thursday you are not going to be here . so Friday , I am stuck all day in a seminar ,
from , eight to five ,
so , Friday is kind of out . hm
okay ,
so next week is no good at all ,
but looking at the week after , &quot; ahm on Monday , I have , &quot; ahm the morning open until ten ,
we could meet from , eight to ten ,
unless nine is the earliest , that would not work then ,
I am also free , Tuesday , &quot; ahm the whole afternoon .
how is your Tuesday .
okay ,
Tuesday I have a class from nine to twelve ,
and then after that I am free for the rest of the day .
so we can get together for a couple hours then , if that is alright with you .
that sounds like a plan .
my class goes until noon ,
give me an hour to have lunch , and , &quot; ahm we will hook up at , &quot; ah one o &apos;clock ,
if that works for you .
okay , one o &apos;clock is fine with me . and then , &quot; ah around how long do you want to , &quot; ah meet for .
because I think around , three hours is good enough for a good meeting ,
how long were we supposed to ,
&quot; ah alright . &quot; ah
we should be able to accomplish everything we need to in two hours . and , &quot; ah well I will see you then ,
why do not we meet , at the ,
&quot; ah hey ,
where we going to meet .
how about the coffee shop , in the , &quot; ah first floor of this , office building .
okay , that is fine with me .
I will meet you there then .
okay ,
hey , we got to hook up again and , talk about this for a couple more hours .
&quot; ahm today is the fifth ,
it is a Monday ,
and , &quot; ahm I am out of town for two days . &quot; ahm the next block I have free ,
will be , actually , all day Friday I have free ,
as long as I can get home by four $ P- $ M .
how does that look for you .
hey , I am pretty busy this whole week actually .
&quot; ah Friday , I have an eight to five seminar .
so , Friday is pretty much out .
and then ,
looking to the week next ,
I am away Monday and Tuesday on vacation .
so ,
it has got to be either Wednesday , Thursday , or Friday next week .
so , tell what times , you are open then .
okay , on Wednesday the fourteenth , I have free , the whole morning , until two in the afternoon .
&quot; ahm Thursday is screwed . it is , completely filled up with a seminar ,
I also have , all day Friday , available ,
I just need to be home by four ,
on Friday again .
okay , Wednesday , I am at the doctor &apos;s office . until ten o &apos;clock . but after that I am free .
so we can meet then if you want . until two ,
or ,
on Friday I am free the whole day also .
so just , either day is fine with me .
it just depends on when you want to do it ,
okay ,
why do not we do it on Friday ,
instead of trying to squeeze it in between our schedules on Wednesday .
sounds like , we are both going to be as busy as a one armed paper hanger on Wednesday ,
so ,
why do not we set that , sixteenth .
the sixteenth on Friday we will meet ,
and ,
&quot; ah why do not we hook up at the coffee shop again .
yeah , I completely forgot about that .
&quot; ahm how about the same time , right after lunch .
one o &apos;clock .
alright , that sounds great .
I will see you there .
hi .
&quot; ahm I would like to make an appointment , on the sixth , of , May ?
do you have any , times available ? on that date ?
&quot; ahm no . I am afraid the sixth is not , free for me .
I am away , until the sixteenth .
so , &quot; ahm after that , I am free the twenty first , if you would like to make an appointment then .
&quot; ah okay . you said you were , away until the sixteenth ?
&quot; ah I am available on the seventeenth .
I am afraid the twenty first , I am not available .
how about , the seventeenth , and if not , the twenty fourth ?
okay .
the twenty fourth I have a doctor &apos;s appointment at four $ P- $ M .
anytime before , say , three o &apos;clock . would be , fine with me .
okay .
how about ten o &apos;clock on the twenty fourth of May .
would be fine .
thank you ,
I see no problem with that , I will schedule in for ten o &apos;clock ,
hi . how you doing .
I would like to schedule a meeting sometime , in June , &quot; ah how does the , eleventh sound .
okay .
the eleventh , any time after twelve , is fine with me .
okay then , I will take a one o &apos;clock appointment .
thank you ,
alright .
one o &apos;clock it is ,
hello . &quot; ahm I would like to make an appointment ,
&quot; ah are , any of the days ,
the seventh , eighth , or ninth , of July open ?
I am sorry .
but the seventh , eighth , and ninth , of July , were last week ,
it is the twelfth right now ?
so , I am free , the thirteenth , and fourteenth .
I am sorry , I feel like such a fool . &quot; ahm the , thirteenth , I have an all day . seminar ,
and the fourteenth I am on vacation .
but , the twenty first , I am open ,
and the twenty second and twenty third , I am open in the mornings .
so ,
okay .
and let us say now the now this trip leaving the twenty sixth of January , Tuesday .
that is just a couple of weeks .
that is two weeks .
yeah , just two weeks away .
so , we will have to make sure we send out our
our e-mails and our notices .
right away .
right .
all right . good .
okay .
thanks and we will be seeing you .
oops .
all right .
well ,
I know that we are meeting now to plan our trip ,
but the next three weeks I am I have got off .
you are on vacation again ?
yup .
wow .
yup . all the way until the twenty sixth .
although the twenty sixth I have got the morning I am busy on the twenty sixth .
you are busy ?
I am busy Wednesday . I have a meeting all day .
mhm .
all day ?
all day .
from nine o &apos;clock ,
I not really free for any extended period of time until June . I have a whole week free in June .
mhm , well the second week I have got almost the whole week .
do you have
in June ?
yeah .
I have the whole week of the second week of June , from the seventh until the twelfth free .
mhm .
okay .
well then , if that is a little unusual that we can actually schedule without straining .
is yeah .
and because it is not a strain , I would like to we should consider our departure time and make it something reasonable .
it
mhm .
maybe this time we might be able get give ourselves enough little extra time there .
yes , oh , yes , yes .
I would like that .
come back .
yeah . what day would you prefer to leave ?
yeah .
oh , Monday would be fine by me .
I
Monday ?
and then , we would arrive like Tuesday morning , Monday night , we would have all day Tuesday in the office .
mhm .
then Wednesday , we could even give ourselves some time Thursday and leave like Thursday night .
yes . oh , I want to do I would yeah .
I agree .
absolutely .
okay . because we haven &apos;t gotten to do that
mhm .
so why don &apos;t we do that , we leave Monday morning .
mhm , let us see ,
what time ?
departure ten thirty ?
ten thirty ?
that is fine ,
we wouldn &apos;t arrive until four thirty $ A- $ M . that might be that is going to be a little uncomfortable but ,
do they have anything closer to like noon ?
oh , well it is six thirty in the morning , ten thirty , and nope .
no .
all right .
and another four hours after that so it is two thirty .
so two thirty .
so I would lean pretty heavily towards the ten thirty departure .
that is fine , the ten thirty then .
and of course nine thirty oh , actually it would be starting much like a regular business day .
mhm .
seven June seven , Monday
mhm .
nine thirty we will meet at the office .
okay .
and head for the ten thirty departure .
head for the ten thirty departure , and , so we arrive four thirty Tuesday morning .
mhm .
we will be in the office ,
probably about nine o &apos;clock ,
maybe ten if we can strain that a little bit , get ourselves some sleep .
oh .
absolutely .
yeah .
have breakfast .
and then ,
we will be in the office for like half the day Wednesday , or we could even do it we are in a office half the day Tuesday and then all day Wednesday .
would you rather do that ?
yeah .
that is I would I prefer that .
okay .
mhm .
give ourselves some time to sleep , and be office all day Wednesday and then we could probably leave Thursday evening .
mhm .
give ourselves some extra time , to see the city .
mhm .
let us see .
oh , we are in luck for scheduling our departures , from Hanover because there are more flights in the evening .
oh , good .
every two hours starting six o &apos;clock to midnight .
six o &apos;clock to midnight ?
okay what time would you want to leave ?
we would be about six hours until we arrive to back here .
mhm .
mhm .
work well . yeah .
six to twelve .
I would kind of like to make it eight .
eight o &apos;clock , arrive at two ?
yeah .
mhm .
okay .
that is Thursday , eight $ P- $ M , local time departure .
the tenth .
okay ?
and then what about hotels ?
I guess we want to be somewhere , where is lots of stuff to see .
yes .
yeah .
there is a Marriott , which is in the central part of the city .
and there is a Parkhotel ? which is five minutes from central station and there is a hotel Cristal in at central station .
yes .
so all , they are all nice and centrally located .
that is
mhm .
which means that they will fit in with our plan to spend that extra time there .
because we can go everywhere do everything .
right .
ah .
too well , I now , after the last trip where we cost a little more than usual I
we yeah , we went a little luxurious .
right .
yeah we should probably tone it down this time .
there is one the Parkhotel is a hundred nineteen Deutsch-marks .
very reasonable .
yeah . it is it has a breakfast buffet .
mhm .
that is the only thing it really offers .
the other two have a sauna and one has an indoor pool ,
and an exercise room . and that is that one is a hundred and eighty five .
and the most expensive one is two eighteen which is the hotel Cristal , which just has a sauna .
well , I don &apos;t think we need the Cristal .
but
mm .
and the other two were Marriott ?
and
Parkhotel .
Parkhotel . oh , I kind of lean towards the Parkhotel myself .
okay .
shall we ?
yeah . I am not one much for exercising anyway .
well what we walking around and shopping is that counts as exercising .
yeah . that is true . we walk around the city .
you know they
yeah . because what we will be centrally enough located that we can do that .
mhm .
is there anything you want to do while we are there ?
a play or
well , I would I don &apos;t have a good grasp on what it is the Hanovarians are into , but I do like opera .
I don &apos;t know if you can stomach opera yourself .
but
mhm .
oh , yeah .
yeah ?
yeah .
yeah .
I haven &apos;t seen much , I never seen it live but I would definitely I mean what I have seen I have enjoyed .
good .
oh ,
well to Germans I think if you are going to see live opera my friends who sing opera in Pittsburgh go to Germany to perform sometimes .
so
wow .
it would be a good place for it .
mhm .
okay .
okay .
so we will try to find ourselves an opera , say Wednesday night ?
an opera ticket ?
maybe we can
well , we have got Wednesday night and Tuesday night .
right ?
Wednesday and Thursday night .
no , Wednesday , and Tuesday night . you are right .
yeah , yeah .
right . so maybe we can
so we can do two of them .
we could do two , we could do an opera and a play .
yes .
see a movie .
yes .
go out to eat .
yeah . it will be fun .
absolutely .
we should e-mail a few everyone in Hanover and ask them what to do .
and suggestions , yes .
yeah .
good .
okay .
okay .
done .
hi Sean .
how are you ?
hi Vivian , I am fine .
how are you ?
good . I see , that we have some business trips that we have to plan .
mhm , yeah , we need to visit the branch located in Hanover Germany , right ?
right .
okay .
let us see .
when would be a good time for you ?
in July I am free the week of the twentieth .
week of the twentieth , okay .
so you are free the whole week ?
basically . yeah .
okay .
I have got some things planned for Monday and Tuesday .
but I don &apos;t have anything on Wednesday ,
Thursday or Friday .
maybe we could take the second half of the week and do the business trip then ?
sure .
let us see ,
from Pittsburgh to Hanover ,
there are flights for every three hours from six in the morning to five thirty in the afternoon .
mhm .
would you like to fly in the morning or in the afternoon ?
well , let us see .
how much time do we need to spend in Hanover ?
one and half day .
okay , one and a half working days . so let us try to leave on that Wednesday , the twenty second of July .
is that all right with you ?
sure , that will work .
okay .
and then , let us try to leave in the morning .
how early in the morning .
let us see .
do you have any preferences ? what are the flight times ?
six nine twelve and three .
okay , how about nine in the morning ?
okay .
so , that is nine in the morning , Wednesday the twenty second of July .
okay .
for coming back , there is a fly for every four hours .
mhm .
from six in the morning until six in the afternoon .
okay , so , we will come back on the following Saturday ?
is that right ?
July the twenty fifth ?
yeah .
okay , let us kind of take it easy .
let us leave around noon or so .
okay .
and then we will have to figure out where we are going to stay , while we are in Hanover .
I have got some information on hotels .
there are three different hotels .
there is the hotel Royal Hanover , there is the Schlosshotel Hanover , and there is also the hotel at the Georgengarten .
let us see .
the Schlosshotel Hanover is the cheapest .
each single room is about a hundred and thirty five Euros .
and then the hotel at the Georgengarten is the most expensive where a single room is a hundred and eighty six Euros .
and then the hotel Royal Hanover is right in between .
do you have any preferences ?
let us just take the middle one .
okay .
let us see .
that is only five minutes from the central station ,
has a bar ,
a restaurant and a parking garage ,
it sounds like a pretty good deal to me .
yeah , sure .
okay .
so , I will go ahead and call them and make the reservations , maybe you can make the reservations for the plane ticket ?
sure .
okay , so , then I will see you later .
okay .
I will see you later then .
okay .
bye bye .
bye .
oh .
hi , Sean .
how are you today ?
hey , I am pretty good , Vivian .
how are you ?
good .
looks like we need to plan another business trip .
mhm .
yeah ,
this one will have to be somewhere in the October ,
November ,
December time frame . let us see . any times that are especially good for you ?
for me the say tenth , eleventh and twelfth of November would be really good .
do you have anything planned those days ?
well , for November twelfth I have a conference that I need to attend .
mhm .
how about at the end of October ?
end of October ?
well ,
that is my vacation ,
I would really not I don &apos;t want to cut into that . I am planning on going to Minnesota .
how about in the middle of December ? say December fourteenth , fifteenth and sixteenth ?
okay .
yeah , that would be good .
I have a dentist appointment on the sixteenth but I can call him and reschedule it .
is no problem .
well , I have a concert to attend on the sixteenth but I guess I can reschedule that , too .
okay .
so , then let us see .
should we fly out on the Sunday before ?
well , I would rather not .
would it be convenient for you to leave on Monday morning ?
sure , we could do that .
well , I have information about express flight on Mondays .
okay .
and it only takes us seven hours to fly from Pittsburgh to Hanover .
oh , wow .
great .
okay , let us do that then .
okay .
express flight on Monday is every six hours from eight in the morning .
would you like to leave that particular flight , eight in the morning ?
yeah , let us get an early start .
okay .
and we can come back on the we are going to need one and a half days , so leaving Wednesday night ?
mhm , that sounds good .
there is a flight for every four hours from eight in the morning to eight in the evening .
okay , so let us say let us leave around four in the afternoon .
that way we will have spent a half a day there on Wednesday and that would have given us the one and a half days that we need for the business trip .
okay ?
yeah , sure .
okay , then again with the hotels .
let us see .
I have got three other hotels here .
there is the hotel Zentral Hanover which is in the middle range .
it is near the train station though , which is good .
there is the hotel Noehre Hanover , which is a little bit cheaper .
it is a hundred twenty five Euros for a single room .
it is five minutes from the central station but it does have a restaurant and a sauna .
and then there is the Prinzenhof hotel which is a little bit more on the expensive end , a hundred and eighty six Euros for a single .
but it has a bistro and video , weight room , a sauna .
do you have any preferences ?
no , not really .
well , since the company is paying for it let us take the Prinzenhof hotel .
okay .
that sound okay with you ?
yes .
okay , great .
then I will call the hotel and make the reservations if you will call the airline and reserve the plane tickets .
sure .
okay , great .
see you later , Vivian .
see you later , Sean .
Vivian , how are you ?
good .
how are you ?
good . thanks . so , it is time to plan another business trip to Hanover .
yes .
and it will be sometime during January , February , and March .
the first week of January it I am out on vacation .
okay . yeah , we wouldn &apos;t want to go then anyway . it is too close to New-Year &apos;s .
let us see .
how about in the first week of February , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday ?
well , I have a staff trip on Wednesday .
and I don &apos;t think I want to miss that .
okay .
how about the first week of March ?
first week of March .
okay . yeah .
that will cut into my vacation a little bit , but sometimes you have to make sacrifices .
I am free on that Thursday and Friday .
so maybe we could fly out on Wednesday , the third of March ?
sure .
I guess I have to reschedule my work meeting .
but that will be okay .
oh , okay .
so for the flight information ,
it leaves every four hours from six in the morning until ten in the evening .
and the last flight out it is at eleven o &apos;clock .
okay .
let us see , every four hours did you say ?
yes .
okay .
how about we leave at ten $ A- $ M on Wednesday , March third ?
okay .
okay .
and then we need to come back Hanover is six hours ahead ?
mhm , yeah .
so , we need to come back on Saturday .
okay .
that is fine with me .
is that right ?
mhm .
that way we can spend Thursday and Friday there to take care of our business meeting .
okay .
Hanover to Pittsburgh , there is flight for every three hours from five in the morning until five in the afternoon .
and flight every three hours from six in the afternoon until midnight .
mhm . okay .
let us leave in the afternoon .
we will probably be pretty tired .
okay . sure .
how about say five in the afternoon ?
okay .
five in the afternoon on Saturday March fifth .
sure .
okay .
sorry , March sixth .
okay .
about the hotels , I have got three hotels here .
the cheapest one looks like the hotel Luisenhof . it is only five minutes walking distance from the central station ,
has a bar ,
restaurant , parking .
and it is only a hundred and twenty nine Euros a night .
so it is a pretty good deal .
then there is the Maritim hotel ,
which is a hundred and fifty one Euros per night .
and then there is the hotel Locurner-Hof .
which is two hundred and forty eight Euros per night .
but it has a swimming pool , a sauna , and a piano bar .
a piano bar .
that sounds pretty good .
yeah .
it does sound pretty good .
is the company still paying for the trip ?
I think they had something to say about last time that we stay in the best hotel .
oh .
okay .
maybe we should play it safe this time .
how about we stay in the hotel Luisenhof , the cheaper one ?
okay .
okay .
sounds good . then I will call the hotel and make the reservation there for two single rooms . and can you take care of the airline tickets ?
sure .
okay , great .
nice talking to you , Vivian .
I will see you later .
see you later .
hi Vivian , how are you ?
good .
how are you ?
pretty good .
so , are you ready to plan our next business trip ?
well , sure .
okay .
let us see .
it needs to be in within the next three months ,
April ,
May and June .
anytime that is especially good for you ?
well for the first full week of April , I have three days , Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday .
and then for the second week of June , I am completely open .
okay .
let us try for the June date .
I am taking a vacation during most of April .
so , let us see .
the second week of June , did you say ?
yes .
okay .
so that would be say Monday the seventh ?
sure .
okay .
let us fly out on Monday .
and then we can have Tuesday and Wednesday to do our business trip .
and then come back on Thursday ?
sure , if that is okay with you .
okay .
for that particular day there are flights for every four hours , from six thirty in the morning until eleven o &apos;clock .
mhm .
okay .
so , would you like to leave early ?
yeah . let us leave early .
okay .
let us say at ten thirty in the morning ?
okay .
and then we will get there on Monday night ,
and have Tuesday and Wednesday to conduct our business ,
and we can fly back on Thursday ?
for Thursday , June tenth , there are flights every four hours from six in the morning until two in the afternoon .
would you like to come back early or late ?
let us come back early .
I want to try to keep Friday the eleventh free , if possible .
okay .
let us come back on ten in the morning ?
okay .
it sounds good to me .
and then for the hotel accommodations , let us see .
there is the Parkhotel Hanover .
which is the cheapest one ,
only a hundred and nineteen Euros per night .
but they do offer a breakfast buffet which I heard was pretty good .
then they have a Marriott hotel in Hanover .
which is it is in the middle ,
a hundred and eighty five Euros per night . and then there is the hotel Cristal Hanover ,
which is two hundred and eighteen Euros per night .
any preferences ?
no , not really .
okay .
let us go for the Marriott .
okay .
okay .
so , I will call the Marriott and make the reservations there .
if you can take care of the plane tickets ?
sure .
can you also see if there is any musical playing locally ?
oh , sure .
yeah , I could ask the hotel if there are any movies or plays around the area .
sure .
okay .
thank you .
sure .
sounds great .
I will see you later .
see you later .
ah , hello ,
Mrs Fody . good to meet you . we certainly still have to work out a date because of our trip to Hanover .
I think , it should take place in the next three months .
have you already thought about when you would have time then ?
yes , that is good , that I meet you .
of course I have already thought about it , Mrs Schwaiger .
well , it would work well for me at the beginning of February .
beginning of February is actually bad for me now .
unless , towards the end of the first week in February .
well , I would have time fifth , sixth , and seventh of February .
yes , that would be great , yes .
well , then I could , yes , because afterwards I am on vacation and
would that work for you ?
you are on vacation then .
well ,
we need at least one and a half workdays and that would then be , then it would be quite convenient ,
if we could leave on Thursday already .
would that work for you ?
yes , that would work very well .
that would work very well , then I could still be at home before my vacation , so to speak .
mhm , yes .
mhm .
then do we want to stay in Hanover for the weekend as well ?
well ,
that would be really alright for me . I would then like to take care of some business in Hanover ,
but we will certainly see then .
have you already thought about how we could get there ?
yes , I have asked about the train and air connection to Hanover .
now I will just ask you , would you rather fly or go by train ?
well , it actually does not matter to me .
in my opinion , we could also go by car . I have a car ,
well a company car . we could drive there together as well . maybe that would be more practical , that we just leave during the day on Thursday , during the morning .
and well , I could offer that to you , let us travel there together .
yes , that is a good suggestion . yes , certainly .
okay .
well , now I also informed myself about the hotels , that we have available there .
well that would be , I found three hotels in the internet , that is first of all the hotel Maritim .
it is still relatively cheap .
I do not know ,
how does it look for you with the finances ,
that you have available ? will you get this paid for by the company ?
I am getting it paid for , yes , yes .
well , we certainly can .
it does not matter at all , how much it is ?
okay , well , the best would certainly be the Loccumer-Hof . it is relatively expensive .
a single room there costs two hundred forty eight marks .
but we would have a swimming pool with it and a steam bath ,
I see right now .
and yes ,
it is relatively central I think .
and also , well ,
the second most expensive is the hotel Maritim , the single room for one hundred fifty one marks .
this is very near to the city center as well .
without a swimming pool though .
well , I am getting it paid for as well .
if you are not bothered by that , then let us take the one with the swimming pool , right ?
yes , of course .
then one can still allow oneself something after the meeting , so to speak .
okay , yes .
good , well , we are then agreed on the fifth of February . and when will we drive back again ?
as I said , I would like to spend Saturday too in Hanover .
good .
yes , since I indeed can ride with you , I will then simply comply with you on the return trip .
that is alright with me ,
eh .
is that okay ?
well . good .
and how does it look with Friday evening actually ?
shall we somehow get ourselves theater tickets or something like that ?
would you be interested in that ?
oh yes , very much .
yes , I was already once there as well , in the theater in Hanover .
that would be , that is a very good suggestion from you .
that
do you already have an idea , what is playing there at the time ?
or
I do not know that yet ,
but certainly one can presumably ask in the internet or else on the telephone at the theater and then possibly also reserve tickets .
yes .
they surely know that also at the hotel then , what is playing there at the time , I think .
or something like that .
exactly .
okay . good .
well , then , we will stay in touch .
we will surely meet each other again in the next few days ,
and then ,
yes ,
we just leave there on the fifth of February .
very good . well .
okay , then I wish you a good workday , much success and , yes , merry Christmas and see you . good bye .
same to you .
yes , good bye .
oh , hello , Mrs Fody . good to meet you .
hello , Mrs Schwaiger .
we should get together sometime because of a time for our trip to Hanover . you certainly still know , then we should go to Hanover for approximately a day and a half to our branch office .
exactly , exactly .
we should arrange that right now .
I have also already asked about some hotels .
right now we should set the date .
very good .
I am just looking in my appointment book .
it actually looks pretty bad for me in the three months of April until June .
but , well , I would for example still have the twentieth until the twenty-second of April free .
would that work for you ?
that is Monday to Wednesday .
April unfortunatly does not work for me at all .
then I have the , mid of the entire month , I have unfortunatly no time at all .
mhm , then
well it would have to take place in May or June , unfortunately .
although I have also many meetings then , but for example the beginning of May would be wonderful for me .
well , that means , around seventh to ninth or , let us even say , sixth to eighth works .
the beginning of May have
that is now bad for me .
I have a business trip from the fifth to the seventh and then it is already the weekend anyway .
on the thirteenth I have a dentist appointment ,
that could take a long time , I just hope ,
that I will not be gone too long then .
how does it look on your end in June ?
for example after Corpus-Christi ?
rather not .
well , now I wrote that down , that I should keep that time free if possible .
better before Corpus-Christi , that would be alright for me .
rather not .
that would work for me too .
eighth , ninth , tenth of June , for example . are you also available then ?
oh , wonderful .
yes , that would be good .
then we could start right at the beginning of the week .
right , right . Monday would certainly be very good , would be wonderful .
okay .
then there just remains the question , will we fly , will we go by train ?
of course that also depends a little bit on the finances now , that we have available .
well , I would gladly fly .
it is faster and then we are also back home faster .
but how does it look for you on your end there ?
yes ,
well I am also for flying ,
I am thinking right now ,
I just think ,
I am getting it paid for . well , last time I drove with a car ,
that was not so pleasant .
well I , I would be certainly agreed with flying .
yes , that is
okay .
well ,
but we can also still wait and you ask once again ,
if you are getting it paid for ,
and arrange that afterwards .
oh , I am rather certain there .
you okay .
good , then , now I have already asked about which flights are going there .
well , during the day , actually hourly .
we want to take off in the morning , right ?
early Monday .
yes , it is the most convenient .
then we have
well , the first flight leaves at five before seven .
I think , that is somewhat too early .
well , it would be quite alright for me , maybe five before eight or five before nine .
yes , I am also for that .
well , the very early one , that is not my cup of tea .
okay , then let us take the one at five before nine , if there are still seats .
I think ,
that should not be a problem . I just happen to see ,
we are flying exactly seventy minutes , so we are rather early there .
and yes , the return flight .
I do not know , should we already arrange that right now , or will we think about it later ?
oh , I think , that we can still see .
well , depending on if one would still like to spend Corpus-Christi in Hanover then .
okay .
that would be an idea , yes , right .
then we could still also do something in the evening ,
something like a trip to the theater or going to the movies or something like that .
yes , somehow doing something cultural there .
yes , if you are also intested there , very good .
okay .
well , now I have only not chosen any hotels yet .
maybe we still have to do it or are you maybe already more clever than I am ?
certainly , yes , I have already asked there .
I have now found out about three hotels there , that I think could be appropriate for our wishes .
that is the Marriott hotel Hanover , the Parkhotel and the hotel Cristal Hanover .
mhm , then how does it look price-wise there . because I am certainly somewhat limited in my finances there .
well ,
I should not absolutely take the most expensive ,
or else I myself will be paying for it and that certainly is not necessary for one and a half days .
yes , well , the cheapest would be the Parkhotel .
I think I would have liked of course to have a sauna ,
that would have been in the , in this Cristal Hanover hotel ,
but a single room there costs two hundred eighteen marks and a double room one hundred seventy-three .
of course we could also take a double room .
mhm .
right . yes , that would be an idea .
but as I said , the Parkhotel is certainly significantly cheaper .
what else does the Parkhotel have inside then ?
well , is relatively centrally located .
well ,
or here it says ,
to the main train station ,
I do not know now ,
what that means , and breakfast buffet ,
well , not yes
does that mean , we only have breakfast and neither half nor full board .
yes ,
like this , I see it here in my , well ,
the others offer just as I said sauna ,
tan-salon ,
indoor swimming pool and so on ,
well luxury as well .
mhm , mhm , mhm .
that is of course certainly tempting .
well , I think , if we share a double room , then it would be certainly within bounds .
good , well then , I would be very strong for this Cristal Hanover , then I will reserve us a double room there .
good , nice .
very good .
okay , Mrs Fody .
then , well , I would say , we will stay in contact and then speak once more about it .
exactly .
we will certainly see each other quite often .
okay , have a nice day .
okay , have a nice day .
hello , Mrs Fody . good to meet you .
would you just have a short moment time .
we should talk about the business trip that we should take to Hanover in the summer months sometime between July and September .
exactly , Mrs Schwaiger , I also wanted to ask you about that .
well , maybe we can set a date first .
uh , it looks very bad for me there . and I also still wanted to take a vacation .
when do you definately have vacation then ? because my vacation is coming up now ,
yes ,
between tenth of August ,
well ,
tenth until the end of August actually ,
I am not here .
mhm ,
well I yes ,
well I have from , it is already end of July until mid August ,
I have taken vacation .
maybe we could even settle it in July , I would find it very favorable .
how does it look on your end on Thursday , the ninth of July ?
mhm .
coincidentally , I also have that free now ,
well ,
I just have to be back again at the very latest on the thirteenth , that is the Monday ,
we have a very important meeting then in our department ,
but I could possibly also on the eighth ,
Wednesday .
that does not work , a business partner is visiting me then .
well ,
Wednesday I can not yet ,
but I also have to be back by Monday at the latest ,
and then we can simply from Thursday until Sunday , or depending on ,
even only until Saturday ,
be on our way .
okay .
good , then let us just stick to this date .
the question still remains , how will we travel there ? by train , plane , or car ?
do you have an idea already ?
well ,
I have of course my company car also ,
but it would be quite alright for me ,
if we would go by train . well , I have asked .
and , good , in case you would not like to go by train now , I have even picked out the flight connections .
oh , well , I am not very fussy .
let us go by train .
good , well the travel time is also bearable .
it would be four and a half hours .
whew , so long , mhm .
oh , well , we will certainly entertain ourselves somehow and it will go by .
I think so too .
yes .
good .
there are connections hourly . starting actually really early in the morning , well , we can very well pick that out for ourselves .
from a quarter to five trains go there hourly , so
oh well , so , then we certainly do not have to leave so early .
I do not know .
when should we arrive then in Hanover .
do they want to discuss something with us in the morning or do you think , that will not start anyway before the afternoon ?
well , I think , they will certainly allow for , that we really have trip , the traveling time .
well , that will start not before the afternoon .
well ,
but I would really say ,
that we around a quarter to eight ,
well ,
that we really should leave here then .
yes .
seven ? eight ?
okay .
yes then we will certainly commit ourselves to the train at a quarter to eight .
okay .
great . good .
then I will also get us both the tickets there .
that would be very good .
well , okay .
well , then as for the hotels , I have informed myself .
I found now three different ones there ,
that are , of course , in the price categories also very different .
I am getting it paid for .
I do not know ,
how it is for you .
do you have to pay attention there somewhat or does it not matter for you now ,
how much this will cost ?
I think ,
I should pay attention there somewhat . well , indeed I am getting it paid for ,
but my boss does not really like to see it there ,
if I reside in the most expensive hotels .
well , one other possibility would be of course , we share a double room .
well , from my point of view there is not a problem there , if that is alright with you .
there we save ourselves a lot of money and can then just choose a hotel in a higher price category .
that would certainly be something .
good , that is a nice suggestion . yes it
well , of course I am speculating on something very special there .
I like to do sports very much and I would have one with a swimming pool available there .
that is the hotel Am-Georgengarten .
a double room there costs one hundred sixty-three marks .
I think , that is within bounds .
yes , that is good .
I think , I have even already heard something about it , but I do not know it .
yes .
yes . yes .
I am not sure ,
I think a collegue of mine was already there .
she thought , swimming pool , sauna , that everything is really great there . there one can certainly stay for two ,
three days .
it is also located relatively central ,
that is , if we want to do something in the evening ,
we are right away everywhere .
then , I will reserve it for us , a double room for the days , that we have now arranged .
is that alright ?
yes , wonderful .
well , I also hope ,
that we then in the evening maybe still , that some time will be left over for us ,
that we then eventually can go to the theater .
yes .
maybe we should already ask about that in advance , in the internet or something like that ,
what is coming up on the theater program at the time ,
we will see .
nice .
okay , then
good , then I am looking forward to it , that we have taken care of it .
okay .
have a nice day .
well , good bye .
see you .
hello , Mr Much .
good that I meet you here .
it is about the following ,
we would have to go to Hanover ,
visit the branch office .
now I wanted you , if you have a short moment , that we could maybe just arrange the time .
do you have your schedule there ?
yes , hello , Mr Bertele , first of all .
yes ,
I have it here . it is lying right in front of me .
then how would it be after the first of January ?
second , third of January I would have time .
it should certainly be a two-day business trip .
that would suit me well .
but the third is a Saturday . I do not know , how that works well for you .
that is bad for me .
I am on vacation then .
now look here . for me , I can tell to you ,
that , I have consecutive days available ,
for example , the fourteenth and fifteenth of January .
that looks bad for me , MrBertele .
I have to go to a fair then .
good , how does it look the twenty-third , twenty-fourth ?
that is okay .
I am also available then .
that is okay .
good , wonderful .
then I would say ,
then let us go with this appointment , we will consider it .
now there is the question ,
how will we get there ?
there is the opportunity of course to fly or to travel by train or with the company car . what would suit you there ?
yes , then I agree with that .
very good .
well , if you , if you do not want anything different , I would prefer the plane .
good , I agree with that .
I have here coincidentally the up to date flight schedule in front of me .
there are connections hourly from four fifty-six . that would be by train , just a minute , by plane , exactly .
during the day hourly from seven oh five $ A- $ M until six oh five $ P- $ M .
Munich , Hanover ,
I just think ,
that one is there in one hour then .
then I would say ,
that we reserve the flight there . actually let us take the one at seven oh five right away , so that we are there on time .
yes , I assume that too .
it is alright .
I have no problems with that .
okay , now the question still remains , of course , what hotel we will visit .
I do not know , do you have any information there ?
yes ,
there are three hotels on my list ,
actually the Maritim hotel in Hanover ,
would be conveniently located at the main train station , fifteen minutes to the center , has a cafeteria and a garage ,
in a single room would cost one hundred fifty one marks ,
in a double room one hundred five .
then a bit cheaper in price , the hotel Luisenhof , five minutes from the train station , likewise restaurant ,
garage , single room one hundred twenty nine , double room ninety-six .
and the hotel Loccumer-Hof ,
likewise near the main train station with swimming pool and steam bath , and piano bar ,
in a single room two hundred forty eight marks and in a double room one hundred forty-three .
I do not know , I just think , that we can take the Maritim hotel Hanover .
that would be around the mid priced category ,
but I think ,
that a swimming pool or steam bath is unnecessary for our business meetings .
well , I think , that would be the best .
cafeteria , garage and fifteen minutes to the center .
I think , that is okay .
good ,
I agree with you there . then it would be best if we reserved two single rooms for one hundred fifty one marks in the hotel Maritim .
yes , then I am also for that .
good , yes , we have certainly two days there .
and I just think , this visit will go until the , six o &apos;clock in the evening or so , according to my information .
how does it look in the evening ?
maybe somehow also go to the movies or take a trip to the theater or so .
what do you think about that ?
well ,
I think rather good about that . well we could certainly go out to eat together and then maybe visit a theater . I would not be adverse to that .
well , I could also take care of the tickets then , or inform myself about what is playing .
well , I would be for that then .
good .
wonderful , then we will do it this way .
then I will reserve the flight .
you take care of the hotel and the arrangements for the evening . and yes , then we have it all settled once again .
thank you .
good , Mr Bertele .
hello , Mr Bertele .
hello , Mr Much .
I have gotten the instruction again , like in the last quarter already ,
that we have to go to Hanover again and keep a business appointment .
it will take two days again , like the last time , now I wanted to ask you ,
when do you have in April two days in a row then free ?
well ,
it looks pretty good for me there from the second to the fourth ,
I would have time even three in a row .
well , Thursday , Friday , Saturday it would be .
that is unfortunately not possible for me ,
Mr Much ,
because I am on another business trip then , from Thursday to Friday . the other possibility would be , for example , the twentieth and the twenty-first of April .
that is a problem , I am on vacation right then .
but it would work for me again after Tuesday the twenty-eighth and in fact three days in a row again .
I do not know ,
how it looks for you then .
that is bad for me , because I have a meeting on Wednesday . let us simply take a look at May .
when would you have time then ?
for example , I have time on the eighth , ninth .
that is wonderful , I am free then also .
since Tuesday , the fifth , I have no appointments then and the eighth , ninth would suit my plans well .
good , then let us take the eighth , ninth .
good ,
I even have here the train and plane connections , I do not know , how it is for you ,
because of the change-over .
we could just use the train .
right , I agree with that then . let us go by train .
I will explain here the connections to you ,
well ,
the connections from Munich to Hanover are hourly from five oh three and the travel time is four and a half hours .
returning ,
well from Hanover to Munich from four fifty-seven . would certainly say , that we take a train at approximately ,
yes ,
let us say , seven o &apos;clock again .
then we are in Hanover at about eleven , eleven thirty .
I think , that would work .
right . good .
let us take a train at seven o &apos;clock , I would say .
good .
and then for the return trip I would calculate , well , the appointment will last until six or seven $ P- $ M .
then , if eating something ,
maybe so after nine ,
ten or something like that ,
then we are at home at about one thirty , two thirty .
I think that is really alright .
yes , good , let us do it this way .
good , do you have brochures about hotels , right ?
yes , I have them right here in front of me .
we have three hotels to choose from ,
the hotel Marriott ,
for example ,
that should be very centrally located ,
near to Kr &quot; opcke ,
indoor swimming pool ,
fitness room ,
good ,
in an emergency one could do without that .
single rooms would be one hundred eighty-five marks .
then we would have the Parkhotel and the hotel Cristal .
the Parkhotel is quite a bit cheaper , costs only one hundred nineteen marks and is five minutes away from the main train station .
the hotel Cristal costs two hundred eighteen marks ,
the single room .
but I just think ,
that we can certainly justify that on company expenses .
I would advocate the hotel Cristal .
I think so too , that that is a reasonable solution . you have dealt yourself with that .
well , I think , that it is a good choice .
how about it then , it was certainly nice the last time in the theater .
would you feel like engaging in any activity after the business negotiations ?
certainly , we can think about something different this time .
I just think , Hanover offers enough possibilities there , to do something in the evening .
yes , good , we can decide that certainly there then .
good ,
than we have it all settled once again , then we will hold on to that date and the train ticket will be organized by you and I will take care of the accommodation myself .
good .
right , Mr Bertele .
thank you , Mr Much
hello , Mr Much .
hello , Mr Bertele .
the following , we have to go to Hanover in this quarter , to visit the branch office in Hanover .
for that I would have to nip away two days for you from your appointment book . how does it look on your end then between July and September ? when do you have two days in row available ?
yes , I can tell you that .
on , between ninth and eleventh of July I still have no appointments whatsoever scheduled in my appointment book ,
well ,
that would work well for me .
wonderful ,
then we can agree right away ,
because I have from Wednesday until Sunday ,
I have also time available .
then I would say ,
that we go to Hanover from the ninth of July until the tenth of July ,
and exactly ,
and visit the branch office there .
the question remains ,
how will we go to Hanover ?
there is the possibility ,
to go by train or by plane or by company car . what would suit you then ?
that suits me well .
I think ,
that we will be more independent with the company car ,
well ,
if it does not bother you . I like to use that .
good , wonderful , then I shall have the company car reserved for the ninth and tenth of July .
from when did you have in mind then , for us to leave ?
time I would say ,
if we leave at approximately eight o &apos;clock by car ,
in order to be in the branch office towards noon and then can see to the business .
good , yes , I have nothing against that .
the return trip would then , I think , Friday at six $ P- $ M the business will have ended ,
so that we at about seven $ P- $ M ,
providing that we do not do anything afterwards , can start off on the trip home to Munich .
yes ,
I would say around seven or eight $ P- $ M ,
so that we can still go eat something nice and then ,
I would say ,
we will then go on home again .
good .
good , I have here a list of hotels and in fact would there be the hotel Royal Hanover .
located in the center .
the single room , I assume indeed , that we will take single rooms , one hundred forty two marks .
then the Schlosshotel Hanover ,
that is five minutes away from the train station ,
with restaurant ,
garage ,
also important ,
I just think , for the company car ,
in a single room one hundred thirty five marks .
and the hotel Am-Gorgengarten ,
with swimming pool ,
restaurant , and bar for one hundred eighty six marks .
well , I just think ,
that one could agree on the first , on the Royal Hanover ,
at one hundred forty two marks with garage .
terrace to sit .
certainly quite good in summer .
well , I think , that , upon that we could , we could take it .
good , then we will take the Hotel Royal .
I agree with that .
Hanover , okay .
how does it look then ,
after the first day ,
well on Thursday evening ,
would you maybe be interested in going to the movies ?
I could take care of the tickets there or also inform myself , what is playing then .
yes , certainly .
of course .
yes ,
of course .
I just think , that that would do us well after such a hard working day .
maybe a bit of relaxation in the evening .
good , alright . yes , then we will see each other on Thursday the ninth of July then , at the latest .
thank you , Mr Much .
thank you , Mr Bertele .
hello , Mister Bertele .
hello , Mister Much .
I have gotten a business assignment ,
that is you and I have to start off on a business trip to Hanover in the last quarter and so I wanted to ask you ,
you know , when you would be free two days in row ?
because ,
this business trip would last two days .
well , I have to consult my planner .
just a second , please . that would work for me on the twenty-third and the twenty-fourth of October .
that is a problem .
I am on vacation then .
how about November , then ?
for me the seventh , eighth for example , that would be Friday , Saturday , would work well .
wonderful , that is right after the main annual conference , I am available then as well .
wonderful . yeah , then we do agree on this date .
I have the train connections and the flight connections here .
or do you want to go with the company car ? that is , I do not know what you prefer .
well , I have to say , I would rather fly .
I absolutely agree with you there .
the plane would indeed be the best transportation which we can use .
good .
during the day the flights leave every hour starting from seven twenty .
I just think ,
that we , if we leave around eight twenty , then we ,
then a lot of time , that we arrive and get to our branch office to Hanover .
that just lasts seventy minutes , the flight .
I agree with you there .
the flight is at what time , did you say ?
at eight twenty .
well , then let us book this flight .
good , and in the evening the flights leave hourly from six thirty-five $ P- $ M .
I would suggest to leave after dinner at eight thirty-five $ P- $ M , would seem appropriate to me .
that is a good time .
so we still have a lot of time to have dinner in leisure and then catch the plane without stress .
yes , I fully agree .
well , do you have the hotel suggestions on hand ?
those I have on hand , that is right .
we have three hotels to choose from , first of all the hotel Zentral Hanover ,
it says here near the train station ,
non smoking floor ,
which is very important ,
I just think , for both of us .
then a garage , well , this is not that important .
single rooms , I just think we will go for single rooms , are one hundred forty-seven marks a night .
then there would be the Hotel N &quot; ohre in Hanover , five minutes away from the main train station , with restaurant , sauna .
the single room for one hundred twenty five marks .
and then we would still have the well known Prinzenhof with very central location , bar , video , weight room .
well , the weight room is maybe dispensable , I would say and a sauna .
single room for two hundred six marks .
well , Mister Much , it is up to you . which hotel would you book ?
well ,
I guess , that the one with the , that the sauna now does not necessarily belong to it .
I would say ,
the first one sounds quite reasonable ,
the Zentral Hanover .
good , then I will arrange that .
then we will book two nights .
single rooms in the hotel Zentral Hanover .
well , how about an evening program after the first exhausting day ?
would you agree to maybe go to the movies or theater or else visit a bar ?
certainly , okay .
we can do that .
I fully agree with you .
maybe we can just have a look at Hanover at night and have a beer in leisure together .
good , then I will order a cultural program , then we can decide together there , what we do .
okay , good .
good .
Mister Bertele , thanks a lot .
Mister Much , thank you .
hi , Mrs Conesa .
oh , hi , Mrs Puchta .
do you have time , that we coordinate a date for Hanover right away ?
yes , that would be quite alright with me , because later on I still have to do something .
great . do you have a planner on you ?
yes .
I will just get it out .
mhm .
good .
well , we should stay up there for one and a half days .
that means , for me it would work at the earliest for example on the twelfth and thirteenth of January .
mhm .
yes , but then we have , on the thirteenth we have a general conference at eleven .
we cannot be gone then .
oh , that one I still do not have , I have not known about that one at all .
well .
then next one for me would be twenty-seventh until twenty-ninth I would be free .
for you ?
January as well ?
yes , well , then I have a dentist appointment at eight , but I could probably postpone that .
and twenty-eight , twenty-nine ?
that works .
ah , then we could already consider that .
yeah , good idea .
mhm .
good .
twenty-eighth , twenty-ninth of January .
shall we fly or train ?
what do you prefer ?
well ,
I prefer ,
if we go by train , then we can also still talk about several things ,
then we have a bit of time .
and you ?
yes , we can do .
well , then we have to get up a bit earlier though .
good .
yeah , we can just do that .
good ,
then let us take on the twenty-eighth in the morning ,
every hour from four fifty-six ,
that means four and a half hours ,
that would then basically be five o &apos;clock in the morning ,
six , seven ,
eight , nine ,
we would be up there then at nine thirty $ A- $ M .
that is enough .
that is good , yeah .
great .
well ,
then we take the train at four minutes to five .
would be up there at nine thirty and we can just book the last train in the evening as well ,
so that we book the one next to the last and the last one ,
so that we can change .
mhm .
yes .
and concerning staying overnight , do you have any preferences then ?
well , I have three hotels here now , which have always been much prefered by us .
first of all I have the Maritim here ,
the hotel Luisenhof and hotel Loccumer-Hof .
they all seem to be quite central .
which preferences do you have ?
such a , well ,
it does not have to be the most expensive one now ,
as far as I am concerned . simply , if it is centrally located and clean .
yes .
so
well ,
this Maritim , that is right at the main train station and also near to the city center and it also has a garage .
well , we go by train anyways . does not matter , then we will go for the Maritim .
I will book that then .
wonderful , good .
train , I will take care of that .
and on , we can certainly go to the movies or something in the evening , right ?
yes , oh , I think we can still decide that spontaneously then , right ?
there
exactly .
we will just get a newspaper there .
right , we can go out to eat too , something like that .
exactly . wonderful .
great . we did that well .
bye , see you .
good , bye , see you .
oh ,
Mrs Puchta , good that we meet now .
we really still have to arrange the date ,
before the holidays start . do you have some time at the moment ?
well , hello , Mrs Conesa . yes , sure , we can do that .
planner is also here , just a second .
mhm .
I will also look on my end as well . are really particularly organized today again .
so .
well , how does it look ?
well ,
it would be alright with me ,
if would could go in May . in fact , how does it look with the first week of May ?
yes .
no , does not work out , because we have to stay there one and a half days .
and exactly in the middle I have a business trip at that time .
the eleventh would work for me .
so , eleventh , twelfth would work .
eleventh , twelfth ?
May .
oh , May , okay .
it works for me then as well . that is two days , that is this Monday and Tuesday , mhm .
exactly .
yes ?
should we go with those then ? because after that I am actually on vacation , that is ,
that means that would be the last date in May for me anyway .
the
good , then let us already confirm those two days .
and then let us now just think about how we are going to get there .
mhm .
in fact I have here now train connection or flight connection .
which one is alright with you then ?
ah , flying is faster , right ?
yes , okay , then we can spend a bit more time there .
good .
and I have flights during the day hourly from six fifty-five .
at what time does that start then there ?
guess around ten .
think , nine , nine thirty , something like that .
mhm .
oh , then let us fly quite early and have then still time there to just prepare ourselves for the meeting .
at six fifty-five .
good , yes .
yes , is alright with me .
and let us take the last flight on the next day back , perhaps at eight thirty-five $ P- $ M ?
yes , then one could really a bit earlier one can still if necessary change reservation then .
good .
then I shall confirm that .
I will still call the travel agency .
mhm .
and how does it look with a hotel ?
well , there I had , well , there I had gathered a couple of things .
we have three there , with which the company always works . one would be Mariott , is pretty central .
has an indoor swimming pool and a fitness room ,
is , like , mid priced category .
then the Parkhotel Hanover is really close to the main train station .
has a breakfast buffet , well , like , a normal one , so it is rather an easy ,
well , a simple thing .
and then we would still have very ritzy , the hotel Cristal in Hanover with sauna and tan-salon .
why not let us allow ourselves that , right ?
mhm .
mhm .
yes , I think so too .
let us just spoil ourselves a bit , good .
right ?
because , we have anyway quite a lot now so , I think , we can do that .
yes , good .
good idea .
I am for that .
good , then I shall take care of the hotel . that we somehow get two nice rooms . and in the evening ?
oh ,
I think then ,
we should still definitely do something .
I mean ,
we still do not know our business partners there .
perhaps they will also have a suggestion , that we do something with them or go out to eat .
that is right .
and if something then still arises ,
well ,
if one happens to go to the movies or somehow also to a Jazz-bar or something like that ,
we can certainly see .
well , good , okay .
good , than we have settled all that , then I shall see you this afternoon again then , right ?
bye .
exactly , exactly .
I will let you know , in case it should not work with the hotel , then I will change reservation ,
so , eh ?
okay .
so , have a nice day , see you later , bye .
mhm .
well , good .
bye .
hello , Mrs Conesa .
oh , hello , Mrs Puchta .
Hanover is just around the corner .
we still have to somehow settle the date .
oh .
well , good that I saw you here now . very good , eh ?
can we do it right away ?
fine , I will just get my planner .
okay , I am also ready .
August looks bad on my end .
that one we can right away
well , is also booked up with vacation on my end .
okay .
well , thank God booked up with vacation .
July would work for me , for example .
eighth , ninth , or tenth ?
I have there , a business partner is visiting us then . I cannot go then .
it does not work .
I could not any sooner than the ninth .
does not work .
ninth and tenth ?
yes ?
shall we do that ?
let us do that then .
let us confirm that immediately .
exactly , because September also looks bad again on my end .
let us make the ninth , tenth of July right away .
fine .
okay . mhm .
I have also asked about flight and train .
what would you prefer then ?
well , I do not really like to fly .
to tell you the truth , I have a fear of flying .
fine ,
then let us leave that with the or I will fly and you well , let us ride on the train four and a half hours .
oh , no .
$ I- $ C- $ E .
well , faster , eh .
good .
it is not possible any faster .
we could start at four forty-three leaves the first one and takes four and a half hours .
that means ,
we would be there then ,
quarter to five ,
quarter to six ,
quarter to seven ,
quarter to eight o &apos;clock ,
quarter to nine ,
quarter past nine .
that will be enough time , that will do .
yes , mhm .
fine .
so let us take then the one at quarter to five , the train .
and back it leaves hourly anyway , that means , we can relatively spontaneously then , when we are finished .
mhm .
exactly .
we will decide that then .
and then off into the weekend .
mhm .
and I have already informed myself about the hotels here .
mhm .
there we have a choice of three hotels , the Royal , the Schlosshotel , or the hotel Am-Georgengarten .
that ,
which I find nice is this one ,
the hotel Am-Georgengarten , which is located pretty centrally , with swimming pool and restaurant .
wonderful .
so I am , I like swimming .
yes ?
right , we can still swim a bit in the evening .
and , like , in the evenings ?
should we also plan something for then ?
oh , we will just buy a newspaper and then look what is going on ?
or inform ourselves at the hotel .
good .
fine , and if we still think of something , then we can already reserve in advance .
exactly .
we will still decide on that . yes , good , than we have settled everything .
right .
great .
see you .
have a nice day then .
yes , bye .
mhm .
oh , Mrs Puchta , do you have some time for me at the moment ?
hello , Mrs Conesa .
yes , okay .
what is it about ?
well , we should discuss the date for our business trip to Hanover .
oh , yes , right , Hanover , yes .
do you have a planner with you ?
yes , I have here .
good , then , because I have now the dates starting from October .
well , it would be good , if we were to manage it still in October .
how does it look on your end in the third week ?
well , I could , although not before the second half of the week , that is , starting from Wednesday .
no , I have to go to the fair in Vienna then . well , than that week is bad .
or the Thursday , Friday before that , that is , ninth and tenth ?
no , on Thursday the architect is coming to our house .
yes , but I can also postpone the appointment .
but I can also postpone the Thursday appointment . well , I have a blood donation appointment , that is not so dramatic .
of the third week ?
right .
well , on the fourteenth basically .
we could also then , the , fly , well , on the thirteenth , fourth , fourteenth for example .
good .
let us confirm the thirteenth and fourteenth .
okay .
and then I have also just picked out the train connections and the flight connections quickly .
and what do you think of flying ? then we will be there faster .
mhm .
gladly , yes .
well then I would suggest that we fly pretty early .
well , we could do , then we will still have a bit of extra time .
well , the first flight is at seven twenty $ A- $ M .
and for the second day back the last one is at nine thirty-five $ P- $ M .
mhm .
should we go back that late ?
because we need only one , not two we need actually only , well , one and a half days .
so , I thought around early afternoon or around mid afternoon , around three $ P- $ M or something like that .
want
well , then
okay , good .
three thirty-five $ P- $ M .
than I will confirm the flight .
great .
mhm .
and accomodation ?
mhm .
I have gathered a couple .
in fact ,
there is for one the hotel Zentral in Hanover ,
then hotel N &quot; ohre in Hanover .
well ,
has indeed a sauna ,
but is not that great .
and also the Prinzenhof in Hanover .
the Prinzen hotel . well , it is somewhat , it seems to be very nice .
has a sauna and is located very centrally .
I see .
fine .
why do you not book that one then .
let us take that , right .
good .
good .
well then , thirteenth , fourteenth ?
mhm .
in case something does not work , we can still discuss it , right ?
okay .
and how about the evening program ? shall we decide on something for then now already ?
I could , for example , reserve theater .
and if we then afterwards do not want that , we can simply return the tickets .
is something the matter ?
yes , that certainly sounds good .
mhm .
good , then I will inform myself there . and will let you know then later .
oh , great , that is great .
good .
see you , right .
bye .
great .
see you , Mrs Conesa .
bye .
hello , Mrs Matysiak .
hello , Mrs L &quot; uck .
well , then let us now plan our business trip together to Hanover .
yes .
but let us just arrange a date first .
that was four days .
yes .
yes .
when would it be convenient for you in July ?
I am free in July , except for two days , I am free all throughout .
I do not have any vacation , either ,
so on Thursday ,
the second , is , I have got something official here ,
and on Tuesday , the fourteenth I have got a meeting as well , so ,
apart from that I could completely comply with you there .
yes , okay , how about Monday , the twentieth until Thursday , the twenty-third of July .
yes .
that would be convenient .
good .
then we can take care of the connection to Hanover for the moment , and then choose the hotels .
yes .
what were you thinking ? did you want to take the train rather , or were you thinking of a plane ?
yes , well , the train , it takes three hours twenty minutes .
I would say , the earlier we are there , then we maybe could still meet with the others , and
yes .
yes , already hold a quick meeting .
exactly , so ,
I would say ,
we could take the plane . the plane would leave at ten past seven $ A- $ M ,
on Monday ,
and would be in Hanover at ten past eight $ A- $ M .
yes .
yes , that would do well .
then we could go straight to the hotel , freshen up , and then
well , then let us immediately arrange the first meeting .
exactly .
well .
as for hotels I have here three to choose from on my list .
there is first of all a centrally located one ,
it has a restaurant and it is in the price category between ninety and one hundred eighty marks .
then one , which is a bit further out of town , I actually would not really recommend it ,
because then we come from the meeting ,
then still have the whole way out of town again .
and then another one ,
it is central and has a conference room ,
and a restaurant , and swimming pool ,
so
mhm .
yes .
yes , in fact , that would be perfectly suitable for our purposes , I would say .
yes .
then let us just book that hotel .
yes . good .
then I will take care of that .
then I will book that .
and I will book the plane .
yes .
what do we want to do in the evening then ?
yes , I just think we have to go to dinner with our business partners anyway .
yes , that would actually be a good idea .
and I do not know , I do not know a lot about Hanover .
we can still ask in the hotel , which restaurants they recommend to us , maybe use the restaurant in the hotel .
yes . yes .
so , we can still discuss this there .
yes ,
and I think later on in the evening program we will see then ,
how the conversation is going on in the restaurant , whether we maybe still go somewhere to a theater , if something nice is on offer ,
or to a concert .
we can certainly decide on that on the spot then .
yes , we can decide on that then .
yes .
good .
then I will take care of the flight now .
yes .
yes , then I am looking forward to going to Hanover with you .
yes , good talking to you . good bye , Mrs L &quot; uck .
good bye , Mrs Matysiak .
hello , Mrs L &quot; uck .
hello , Mrs Matysiak .
shall we plan our trip to Hanover now ?
yes .
there is , I have a very busy schedule this year , but a date can certainly be found .
yes , you will certainly still be able to take off three days .
yes , I just think , we are not going in December , but rather in October .
yes ,
it would suit me better as well ,
because afterwards there are a lot of work meetings ,
and then we could maybe already present the results of this business trip .
yes .
I think so , too .
yes , it well ,
it is only very problematic , then we are probably going to take ,
I think we had said four days ,
we are going to take .
yes , three or four .
three or four ?
then I would say ,
we shorten to three ,
because otherwise with four days I am moving into my weekend with other appointments .
then I would suggest on the seventh of October , that is a Wednesday , we go .
mhm .
seventh . would it maybe also be possible on the sixth already ?
no , there is a fair then .
I cannot possibly make it then .
well yes , then let us just take the seventh .
yes .
yes ?
okay .
then I think ,
then we should also fly ,
because the train certainly ,
in my opinion , the train ride takes too long then , if there are really only three days , and not four .
then .
mhm .
yes , I think that is also a good idea .
in fact , is , let us fly from the Cologne-Bonn airport then ,
at ten past seven ,
arriving in Hanover at ten past eight .
yes , that is wonderful .
when would we then fly back on Friday ?
that would be at three thirty-five $ P- $ M from Hanover , and then at four thirty-five $ P- $ M we would be at the airport Cologne-Bonn .
is there no later connection ?
no .
there is nothing .
well , there are later ones , but they are only from Monday to Thursday and
I see . well , then we have to make sure that we finish our meetings during those two days .
yes .
yes , then I would say , let us just choose a hotel .
so , I have here the hotel Eden available , that is four kilometers from the city center .
the hotel K &quot; onigshof is centrally located ,
has a restaurant and a conference room .
or the hotel Pelikan ,
that is three kilometers away from the city center ,
but apart from a restaurant and a conference room it also has a sauna .
well .
well , I just think , we will not have as much time for everything to
yes . no , we will not have that much time .
it would be best if we could actually take that one , where we are not somehow so much distracted . by special
I think so , too , well , the hotel K &quot; onigshof is well suited .
yes .
yes , and we can even then maybe organize the evening program together with our business partners .
yes ,
but I think we should stick to the dinner then , because three days , it is all very compressed regarding the meetings .
to go even pompously to a concert or to a theater then ,
there will be no time left for that .
that is right .
I think so , too . well , then we really arranged that now . then we can now jumps into work again .
yes .
thanks a lot , Mrs Matysiak .
good bye , Mrs L &quot; uck .
hello , my name is Matysiak .
I would like to book a trip to Hanover .
which date did you have in mind ?
well ,
because my time is very limited , well , I would really like it ,
if it could be in January between the eighteenth and the twenty-third .
between , or from to ?
so Monday ,
no , between , so
date of departure between the eighteenth , that is a Monday , and the twenty-third , is a Sunday , no a Saturday .
Saturday .
yes , exactly .
so , I would like best , if I could go on Monday , and could already travel back on Wednesday .
good .
yes , eighteenth , Monday , there is something left , no problem at all . how would you like to travel there ?
by train , or did you have a flight in mind ?
I would like to fly .
good .
in fact , the earliest plane , if possible .
yes , the earliest one flies at ten past seven $ A- $ M from Cologne-Bonn .
and flies one hour , so is in Hanover at ten past eight then .
mhm .
business or economy class ?
business . costs , special fare at the moment , six hundred thirty return trip .
oh .
well , then you could maybe book the flight for me .
yes , I shall make a mental note of that .
yes ?
and what kind of hotels in Hanover do you have on offer ?
which price category did you have in mind ?
we have
well , I would like a hotel best , which is very centrally located .
very very central .
yes .
yes , we have actually only one there , which is really centrally located , it is the hotel Gildehof .
it has a restaurant and a conference room , and a single room costs seventy-eight ,
that is between seventy-eight and one hundred five marks .
yes , that sounds actually very acceptable .
a single room .
then I will book that for you .
a single room ?
good .
would you then also have any suggestions for an evening program in Hanover ?
because I just do not know a lot about it , and possibly
yes ,
as regards the evening program , this is a difficult matter , because the catalogs have not come yet .
I can simply send you a program of the theater , cinema , or concerts later on , so before you fly in any case .
I really do not know ,
what you there , in which direction you were thinking there ,
but I can send it to you then .
yes , that would be very nice .
then I will give you my fax number right away .
then you could maybe fax it to me .
yes , I will do that .
as soon as I have something here I will fax it to you .
good , thanks a lot .
good .
thank you .
bye .
good bye .
hello , my name is L &quot; uck .
hello , Matysiak .
I would like to book a trip to Hanover , it is so , that the trip is supposed to take four days .
in which month would you like it ?
I would like it the best in April .
mhm .
and when exactly ?
around the fifteenth week .
so ,
I would like best to go on Tuesday ,
and would come back on Friday ,
or , yes ,
no Saturday .
yes , that can be arranged .
how would you actually like to travel there ?
by train , or would you rather like to fly ?
rather by train .
that takes three hours twenty minutes .
yes , no , that does not matter , I have time .
yes , good .
so , you could go by $ I- $ C- $ E from Bonn every hour starting from six forty-five $ A- $ M .
that would cost ninety-four marks plus seven marks $ I- $ C supplement .
every hour .
every hour ?
well , then I will rather go late in the afternoon , in order to be in Hanover sometime in the evening .
is that possible , or is there
so , at about four $ P- $ M ? that is , four forty-five $ P- $ M .
then you will be there approximately at seven $ P- $ M , or eight $ P- $ M .
yes . yes .
yes , that is
yes , that would actually do .
yes .
well , then I will just book the train at four forty-five $ P- $ M for you .
yes , wonderful .
well ,
there is still the question of the hotel . it is so , that I would rather have a quiet one outside of town .
if anyhow possible with a sauna or some sort of a swimming pool ,
or something , or whirlpool , or whatever they have over there .
yes .
then I can recommend to you the Treff hotel Europa , that is eight kilometeryes
yes .
yes , that is very nice .
I will take that one .
would you also like to know how much it costs ?
well yes .
so , the prices vary between one hundred ninety-five and five hundred seventeen marks for a single room .
well , then I shall book a single room . you can settle it like that .
good , then I will also book a room for you .
yes .
would you also like to have some information about an evening program maybe ?
so , I would have a city guide of Hanover to offer here .
yes ,
you could fax me something , especially about concerts , or I , to me you could , do you have it there , then you could give it to me .
yes , I can quickly make copies from the guide for you , and
yes , about well , I would be very interested in concerts .
why , sure .
I will gladly do that .
good , thank you then .
good .
yes , thanks a lot , Mrs L &quot; uck .
good bye .
good bye .
hey , how is it going ?
good .
I guess we better go ahead and plan this trip out .
all right , do you have your schedule with you ?
yeah , it is right here .
okay .
let me see .
we are going to need three days because it is a twelve hour flight over and then we will need to be there for a day and then a twelve hour flight back so .
right .
three days all together .
right .
my first three day opening is the seventh of January through the ninth . no , not going to happen .
okay ,
then my next one is going to be anytime in the second through the sixth of February .
that is fine .
oh , that will work ?
okay .
I guess then might as well go ahead and do it early in the week . do it the second through the fourth ?
sure .
of February ?
okay .
and I guess we need to decide what time we are going to leave at .
I checked in to some of the flights and the flights leave every three hours from six o &apos;clock in the morning to ,
I guess ,
five thirty five in the afternoon . and it is they are six hours ahead of us in time ,
so whenever we get there , you know , it is going to be six hours plus so .
it is a twelve hour flight ,
so if we left at six in the morning from here ,
we will get there by six in the afternoon our time .
then tack on another six hours , you are looking at midnight their time so .
I probably would not want to get in much later than that .
right .
so , what ?
we probably ought to go ahead and head out at six because if we would leave any later than that we will be getting in at three in the morning there .
yeah .
okay , let us leave at six .
okay .
and then on the way back , they are six hours ahead of us so .
if we leave here well there it goes six in their time it goes from six o &apos;clock to eighteen hundred which is what ?
six o &apos;clock in the afternoon , again .
and since they are six hours ahead of us , that is really going to be zero hours to twelve hours our time . so tack on twelve hours to anything in that range and that is when we would be arriving back here so .
what time do you think you would want to get back to the $ U- $ S or to Pittsburgh ?
you don &apos;t have anything ?
nothing pressing ?
well I
mhm .
I am not really sure .
it really does not matter .
okay . well
probably as early as we can .
okay .
well then , let us just leave at six o &apos;clock from there .
okay .
and our sleeping will be pretty messed up but that is okay .
we will sleep on the plane .
by the yeah , sleep on the plane .
that is a long flight ,
twelve hour flight .
and I yeah ,
they are going to have meals and everything on that flight .
so we should be okay as far as that is concerned . so , that is going to be we are going to leave out on the Tuesday ,
the second ,
at six o &apos;clock and then we will return on Thursday , the fourth of February .
departure time from Germany at six o &apos;clock in the morning .
okay .
sounds good .
well ,
I guess ,
you know ,
we are going to have that evening when we are up there and we won &apos;t really ,
you know ,
be doing anything after the meetings . have you thought about maybe what you would want to do ?
I mean we probably yeah , I wouldn &apos;t I would say we ought to do something together .
go out , you know , maybe a movie .
I don &apos;t know .
we could see some movie in a language we can &apos;t understand , I don &apos;t know .
so or maybe a play , something like that .
I don &apos;t know .
mhm .
I
a movie sounds fine with me . maybe they will have subtitles .
no .
yeah ,
we will probably go to a restaurant before that . you know , I got a friend of mine who is telling me about a really good place in Hanover we might try .
let me think .
is there any thing else we need ? oh , yeah .
how are we going to get from the airport to our hotel and what hotel should we stay at ?
do you have I think you might have looked into that did you ?
yeah , I have the list of hotels here .
there is the hotel Royal Hanover , the Schlosshotel Hanover and the hotel at Georgengarten .
okay .
so , we have three choices .
all right .
what was that first one ?
that sounded good to me .
hotel Royal .
yeah , it sounds great .
it is company tab anyway so .
mhm .
sounds good .
anything with royal in it . so let me think . is there anything else we need to take care of ?
oh ,
I guess we will just probably ,
you know ,
take a taxi or something like that .
I am sure they have you know , it is a good size city ,
so we will just take a taxi from the hotel . that way , we really don &apos;t have to be concerned if ,
you know ,
we get in late and calling ahead to let the shuttle or limo know so .
yeah .
right .
that sounds good .
well , I guess that is about it .
I will have my secretary put in tickets for the both of us and reserve our rooms .
okay .
all right .
I will see you then .
all right , bye .
bye .
hey , how is it going ?
great .
I guess we better plan this second trip .
well , that last one went pretty well , so .
mhm .
gosh , I have got my schedule here .
we need to do it sometime , you know , within the next three months , April , May , or June .
I guess what is today ?
today is the fifth ,
isn &apos;t it ? so , I guess the first available time for me is going to be the eighth through the tenth of April .
how is that looking for you ?
I have to donate blood on the eighth .
oh , okay .
I will try and yeah ,
I will try and see if we can find something else .
what about the twenty ninth of April through the first of May ?
I have a well , I have a party at seven thirty at night on May first .
okay .
but if we are back in time , maybe .
okay .
all right , we will look at everything else first .
what about the twenty fifth through the twenty sixth of May ?
that is only two days .
we isn &apos;t our trip three days ?
oh , twenty fifth through the twenty seventh .
yeah , you are right .
twenty seventh is my parents &apos; anniversary party .
oh , okay .
all right .
what about the twenty first through the twenty third of June ?
it is fine . that is fine .
okay .
so , I guess we will do it then . let me think .
yeah , there shouldn &apos;t be anything too pressing right after that .
that should work out well for me .
we are going to need to leave early . one thing to think about is it will probably take us about an hour ,
you know ,
to get to the airport before we take off .
right .
so ,
I suppose if we are going to get there ,
you know ,
it is a twelve hour flight and then they are six hours ahead of us .
so even if we leave I am not sure what the times are available but I had written them down here .
okay ,
we leave every four hours from four o &apos;clock to two to ,
I guess , twenty hundred which is eight o &apos;clock at night two thousand , whatever .
I don &apos;t know ,
I never was in the military . so . but at any rate . so , we need we are probably going to need to be leave at either four or eight . if we leave at four we will get there at ten o &apos;clock their time .
if we leave at eight we are getting there at two o &apos;clock their time which ,
I mean I don &apos;t know about you ,
but that is pretty late for me .
mhm .
I would you know , I would rather just go ahead and
yeah , let us leave early .
try and leave at four .
that is really going to be getting up early ,
too because we are going to have to get up at three .
but ,
you know ,
it is a long flight .
you can sleep the whole way ,
you know .
mhm .
twelve hour flight , just wake up for meals .
sure .
another option is what day did we decide on ?
the twenty first , twenty second , and twenty third ?
of June , yeah .
okay ,
then another option is that there is an express flight on Mondays that leaves every six hours from eight o &apos;clock on and it is a the duration of the flight is only seven hours .
so , if we do that we would get there , you know , at a reasonable hour .
what that what would that be ?
eight o &apos;clock ?
you would be there at three o &apos;clock our time add six hours nine o &apos;clock their time leaving at eight o &apos;clock .
that sounds a lot better to me .
yeah , it does .
I mean , we are not paying for the flight anyway , so .
right .
sounds good .
let us I say we do that .
you know ,
we won &apos;t be able to do that on the way back but it will at least save us a lot of time and help with the jet lag on the way there .
then on the way back we can leave every four hours from eight o &apos;clock to two to eight o &apos;clock in the morning until ,
I guess , eight o &apos;clock in the evening . and so I say we go ahead and leave early from there because we are going to have to get up early to go to our meeting so we will be on that sleep schedule anyway .
okay .
sounds good .
you know ,
twelve hour flight ,
I mean ,
we will get you should get here and still have a ,
you know ,
significant portion of your day left . that is a you know that is going to be twelve hours ,
I don &apos;t they don &apos;t have an express flight back .
okay .
as far as whenever we get there I say ,
you know ,
get a taxi , something like that ,
you know ,
figure it out whenever we get there .
some of these flights have a tendency to get delayed and you can get caught up in customs and it is kind of a mess and so whenever that happens , you know , I would rather just not have somebody waiting for us and feel like we had to make a time .
right .
so , taxi cab should do it .
so , we will leave at eight o &apos;clock .
hour it takes an hour for the airport at the airport , so that is going to be seven o &apos;clock at least .
so ,
that shouldn &apos;t be too bad .
not like four o &apos;clock it was going to be . do you have you looked into the hotel at all ?
yeah . there is three hotels we can choose from .
there is the hotel Zentral Hanover , and it is near the train station .
it has non smoking floors and a parking garage .
for a single room it is a hundred and twenty seven Euros a night and for a double room it is a hundred and six Euros a night .
then there is the hotel Noehre Hanover .
it is five minutes from the central station restaurant .
there is a sauna close there and there is convenient parking .
and a single room is a hundred and five Euros a night and double room is seventy five Euros a night .
and the third one is the hotel Prinzenhof .
it has got a weight room and a sauna and a single room is a hundred and sixty six Euros a night and a double is a hundred and forty three Euros a night .
so , the cheapest one seems to be the one that is closest to the central station .
mhm .
so ,
we should probably go with the hotel Noehre . it is German , I am not sure how you say it ,
but hotel Noehre Hanover .
okay .
all right , that sounds good .
yeah ,
I think I had heard that .
it was a ,
you know ,
pretty decent hotel so that will work .
oh , yeah .
what do you want to do that evening ?
you know the second evening we are there we won &apos;t really have anything going on .
just hang out at the hotel or I guess we could go see a movie , maybe a play , something like that .
go to a bar or a restaurant .
I don &apos;t know , what do you want to do ?
well , we could go see a play there .
last time we went to see a movie so let us try something different this time .
okay ,
that sounds good .
well ,
is there anything else that we need to take care of ?
I am trying to think , I guess . to recap ,
we will go ahead and just plan it for was that June twenty first through twenty third ?
yeah .
okay , sounds good .
I guess I will see you then .
all right .
bye .
bye .
hey , how is it going .
good .
guess we are going to knock out this last trip .
mhm .
last one .
well ,
I mean ,
you know ,
the first two have gone pretty well . I think that they have been pretty satisfied .
we have been pretty satisfied .
we you know , we met some mutual goals . so hopefully this one will go that well .
well , what is today , the ninth ?
I am looking at July and anytime thirteenth through the seventeenth looks okay for me .
how is that looking for you ? can you get a three day ?
yeah , I can go July fourteenth to the sixteenth .
okay .
well , do you think that you would want to go then or you want to look at some other possible dates ?
is something better for you maybe ?
no I am pretty much booked for the rest of the that month .
that sounds good .
okay , fourteenth through the sixteenth it is .
give us a day on the week and then come back just in time for the weekend . that will be great .
mhm .
and then I will I am going to turn around right after that and go on vacation for a couple of weeks .
so , it is going to be pretty nice .
have almost a month off .
yeah , and I will have a few days to rest before my golf tournament .
okay .
so that I guess that will settle it .
I guess we need to decide ,
you know ,
when you want to fly out .
on the other trips ,
you know ,
we flew out at six in the morning .
I don &apos;t know about you but that worked pretty well for me leaving early .
they don &apos;t have an express flight this time so we are going to have to bite the bullet and fly for twelve hours .
but , I don &apos;t know , it is not that bad .
you know , they bring you good food and
yeah , let us do that again .
the six o &apos;clock ?
yeah , six $ A- $ M .
yeah .
okay , that sounds real good .
so ,
that will put us in Hanover six o &apos;clock .
they are six hours ahead of us so that is really twelve and then add twelve hours .
we will be there at midnight .
yeah , that shouldn &apos;t be too bad and that is what we done before , I think .
that one time that express flight was great though ,
you know ,
it was so quick and saved us a lot of time . so , we will do that on the way over .
coming back to Pittsburgh we can leave well ,
you got to think also we are going to have to get up at five in the morning because give at least an hour to get to the airport and everything like that so it will be tough but it is better than getting in at , you know , four o &apos;clock in the morning their time .
that would be the next available .
so , we will do that . on the way back we can leave at five or nine o &apos;clock .
since they are six hours ahead of us I say let us leave at nine o &apos;clock and ,
you know ,
that will put us in the $ U- $ S at what three plus twelve , fifteen ,
three o &apos;clock in the afternoon here .
yeah .
that shouldn &apos;t be too bad .
won &apos;t have to really come into work so that would be good .
yeah ,
that should work and yeah ,
we will do that . that way we won &apos;t kill ourselves like we did last time getting up so early in the morning .
right . yeah .
that will
and you are six hours ahead , that was horrible .
yeah , that was pretty bad .
and then I suppose ,
you know ,
that taxi cab thing has worked great the last few times as far as getting to and from the airport .
we will just do that again .
yeah .
in the evening what do you think you want to go see maybe a sight or two or do something like that ?
maybe I could have my secretary check ahead and see , you know , some points of interest that we could maybe go to do something like that .
you know ,
movie and play were okay but , I would kind you know , I might as well see something if I am going to be over there .
I am sure there is something of interest in Hanover , you know , that
yeah , let us just do that .
we can walk around downtown or something like that .
yeah yeah , that is cool .
so , but
it is you know , it is a pretty nice city , so .
yeah , we need to decide what hotel we are going to stay at , too .
oh , yeah . I forgot about that .
yeah , I have checked into that and there is three we have three choices again .
there is the Maritim hotel Hanover which is at the central station and there is parking close there and a cafeteria and the single is a hundred and thirty one Euros a night .
there is the hotel Luisenhof which is also close to the central station ,
it has a restaurant and that is a hundred and nine Euros a night .
and then there is the hotel Loccumer-Hof which is again close to central station but it has a swimming pool ,
a sauna and a piano bar and a single room is two hundred and twenty eight Euros a night .
mhm .
so
well , I will tell you what .
I think my boss was a little upset over we got a pretty nice place that last time and travel budget is kind of getting tight .
tight .
I had a little bit of trouble getting approval for this trip so if we could go with the cheapest one ,
if you don &apos;t mind ,
that would probably be best for me .
no , that is fine .
I just I don &apos;t know .
I think he saw the plane ticket and the hotel and
yeah .
we ate pretty well so he noticed it so I think we will just do that .
okay , hotel Luisenhof then .
okay .
okay , sounds good .
okay .
I guess that is about it .
you got your passport ?
yeah .
okay .
don &apos;t forget that .
that is a put it around your neck so you won &apos;t lose it .
yeah .
and
you got your German English dictionary ?
yeah . I guess that will do it .
I will see you then .
all right .
bye .
bye .
hi ,
Kim . I understand we have to take a business trip to Hanover . I was wondering if you could check your schedule to see when maybe we could get about three days together to go ?
okay .
that sounds good .
let us see here .
today is the sixth .
were you thinking this month or
I have three days together in February , the second third and fourth .
okay . I am open there , also .
okay .
actually I am open yeah , the second through the sixth .
okay , we could leave any of those days .
is there any day in particular you prefer ?
Tuesday , the second is fine .
okay .
do you have the flight schedule of when we could leave ? the times ?
yes , I do .
let us see .
Barbara , according to my schedule they begin leaving at six $ A- $ M and they run every three hours .
okay .
maybe we should go early in the morning since they are ahead of us in time by six hours plus it is a twelve hour flight .
how early would you like to leave ?
okay .
well , early morning is good for me .
okay .
if we plan a flight for say six in the morning it is going to take us about half an hour to get to the airport .
right .
so , we would have to be leaving home of about five , five thirty . was that too early ?
no , that is fine .
okay , then why don &apos;t we plan that .
we can leave at six on the second of February .
okay .
okay .
how are the return flights ?
return flights ?
same time , every four hours beginning six in the morning .
okay .
we need a day there so we will probably need to come home Thursday .
so
Thursday .
all right .
what time do you think would be a good time to plan the trip home ?
I would say early morning again so if they are six hours ahead of our time .
right .
okay .
okay .
if we left at six $ A- $ M we would get back into Pittsburgh around twelve noon .
does that work for you ?
I think that would be good .
okay .
I have a list of some hotels here .
we need to decide where we want to stay while we are on our trip .
great .
I have three choices ,
there is a hotel Royal Hanover .
it has a cafeteria ,
a terrace and a parking garage and the price is a hundred and twenty two Euros for a single and a hundred and four Euros for a double .
there is also the Schlosshotel Hanover .
it is five minutes from central station .
it has a bar , restaurant and parking garage .
it is a little cheaper .
its single is a hundred and fifteen Euros and a double is ninety six Euros .
and the third choice is the hotel at Georgengarten .
it has a swimming pool , a restaurant and a bar .
the price on it is for a single is a hundred and sixty six Euros and double a hundred and forty three Euros .
and how are the locations ?
the Schlosshotel Hanover is five minutes from central station .
that might be a good place to stay .
we could take the train if we needed to get around .
how does that one sound to you ?
that sounds good .
I would rather be in the middle of everything close .
okay .
I will go ahead make the reservations for the Schlosshotel in Hanover .
would you rather have single rooms or double rooms or a double ?
I would say a double .
okay .
we will save the company some money that way .
while we are there is there we should have an evening there because our business shouldn &apos;t take all day .
we could go see a movie or go to a play or maybe do some sight seeing .
okay .
do we have any information on the plays that are in the area or
no , we really don &apos;t have any information .
we could decide while once we got there we could get some information .
okay .
whatever you prefer whether you prefer ,
like I said ,
a movie or a play or we could go sight seeing somewhere .
actually sight seeing would probably be good .
okay , that sounds like fun .
we can check with the tourist bureau as soon as we get there , find out what there is to do .
okay .
okay .
that looks like we have our trip set then . so , I will see you when it gets closer to time .
bye .
okay , sounds good .
bye bye .
hi , Kim .
how are you ?
I am good Barbara . how are you doing ?
I am fine .
I guess we need to plan a trip to Hanover sometime in April , May or June .
today is the fifth of April .
do you have your schedule there that you could check to see when you have three days that we could make this trip ?
sure do .
looks like my first three days free would be April twenty eighth , twenty ninth , and thirtieth .
okay .
the twenty eighth is not good for me of April .
how about May twenty fifth through the twenty seventh ?
if we could leave on May twenty fifth and be back early the twenty seventh that would be good .
I my parents are having an anniversary party on the twenty seven .
okay . okay .
that is probably going to be a little tight . how about around the twenty first of June ?
I have a conference in Boston so that is really not good at all for me .
not good for you .
okay , let us see .
how about a little earlier ?
April eight through the tenth , that is a Thursday , Friday and Saturday .
I am donating blood that Thursday but I think I can rearrange that schedule that we could go ahead and go on the eight , ninth and the tenth .
okay , as long as you don &apos;t mind traveling over the weekend .
no , that would be fine .
okay , good .
all right .
let us do it .
okay , do you have a list of some flight times when we could plan this flight ?
I just happen to .
looks like they are running every four hours .
twelve hour flight .
the earliest is four $ A- $ M .
that is a little early .
that is a little early .
how about around tenish or so ?
okay , we have to allow for the twelve hour flight and then they are six hours ahead of us .
mhm .
so maybe we would be better off going a little earlier if that is all right with you ?
okay .
you want to try six ?
I think that would be good .
okay .
and if we plan that trip for six then when should we schedule for our flight home on the tenth ?
flight back .
the tenth is on a Saturday . okay . I would say around the same time .
you want to leave at six ?
get home early in the yeah .
get home early in the afternoon .
that would be good .
then we will still have most of our weekend .
okay .
okay , that looks like that plans that part of the trip .
I have a list of hotels here .
I have three choices for us to stay at .
first of all I have a hotel Zentral Hanover .
it says it is near the train station and it also has non smoking floors .
single room is a hundred twenty seven Euros and a double room is a hundred and six Euros .
okay .
okay , do you have an exchange rate ?
no , I don &apos;t .
then I also have a hotel Noehre Hanover .
it is five minutes from central station , it has a restaurant and a sauna there .
it is a little cheaper .
it has single is a hundred and five Euros and double is seventy five Euros .
and my last choice is hotel Prinzenhof and it has a bistro ,
videos and weight room and sauna .
that sounds good .
okay .
how far is that from
it says it is central so it shouldn &apos;t be to far .
okay .
should be centrally located for us .
the price on it was singles a hundred sixty six Euros and doubles a hundred forty three Euros .
since it is a little bit more maybe we ought to go for the double room while we are there ?
okay , sounds good .
okay .
we ought to have a free evening while we are there .
the meeting shouldn &apos;t take all day on Friday so do you think maybe you would like to go to a movie or see a play ?
what time is the meeting scheduled for on Friday ?
I think it is scheduled about ten o &apos;clock Friday morning .
okay .
so we pretty much really don &apos;t know how long the meeting will take so but we probably will have our evening .
okay .
we can even just go to a restaurant if you would like .
that sounds good .
okay .
we can plan to have a nice dinner while we are there .
maybe something that we don &apos;t usually have back here at home .
okay .
I like that idea .
okay , that looks like we have our trip planned .
I guess I will see you closer to the time .
okay , Barbara .
thank you .
I will see you .
bye .
thank you .
bye bye .
hello , Dan .
hi .
how about that trip we have to make in a few months ?
okay .
do you have time to make arrangements for it now ?
well , yeah .
is now is as good as ever .
okay .
do you have your calendar handy ?
yeah .
I sure do .
okay , let us see .
we have got to pick a time that is good for both of us .
all right .
what is a good time for you ?
well , us I guess about the best time would be in March .
oh , March is good for you ?
yeah ,
okay .
now let us see .
we have got to have a three day trip , one for travel , one for the actual
business .
business and then one to get home .
what about the first of the March ?
like March second , third , fourth , fifth . is that good for you ?
no no , I have a conference on the third , fourth and fifth .
okay . what you said in March , so what is good for you that month ?
about the best is at about twenty second of March .
on a Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , or Thursday I am not doing anything .
well , I am open there , too .
okay , I have a flight plan somewhere .
let me look here .
I will lose something .
okay , let us see .
starting at six o &apos;clock we can get a flight every three hours up until about five thirty that night .
I believe it is a twelve hour flight .
yeah .
and then there is the time change of what , six hours ?
six hours .
okay .
well , let us see .
the earliest let us see . I don &apos;t like a six o &apos;clock one .
how about if I try to get a nine o &apos;clock flight ?
that sounds good .
get nine o &apos;clock .
that will get us let us see . if we leave Monday , we will travel Monday .
that will get us there early Tuesday .
we could sleep that day and then have the meeting with the at the business branch there on Wednesday and Thursday we could come home .
how does that sound to you ?
okay , that is good .
yeah , because I have to I have a recital coming up on the Friday .
okay . early ?
I don &apos;t no no , it is eight o &apos;clock in the evening .
okay .
so , what about were you going to get a list of the hotel ?
yes .
we could stay at hotel Royal Hanover or Schlosshotel Hanover or the hotel at the Georgengarten .
but
okay , now we need at least an hour to get to the branch office there .
well
wonder which would be the closest to
well ,
I think we would rather better pick the one that either the hotel Royal Hanover or the Schlosshotel because the Georgengarten does not have a parking garage and we want to put our rent car in our parking garage .
okay , we could probably get rent a car at the airport and go there .
yes .
okay .
and could you make the reservations then at one of those ?
okay .
yeah , I think I would rather be at the Schlosshotel .
I will make arrangements there .
okay , and I will get the reservations for the flight .
let us see .
probably that we will need to get to the airport let us see .
if the flight is at nine o &apos;clock , we should get there at eight .
we will probably how about if I pick you up at seven thirty ?
that sounds good .
okay .
now they always have plans for that evening after we get back from the branch .
what would you like to see a movie , a play or just go to a restaurant ?
well
yeah . well , a movie is fine with me .
okay .
well , we can decide that when we get there .
see what they have showing .
okay .
I will get you the times then once I make the reservations for the flight .
yeah , and I will get you the reservations we make at Schlosshotel .
I will let you know about them .
okay .
well then I will get in touch with you when I get that information . thanks a lot . see you later .
okay .
goodbye .
bye .
hello there , Dan .
how are you ?
okay .
we have that or that business trip coming up soon .
I think we better make some plans if you have time to do that .
well , yeah .
well , I will just take time because we have to get it arranged .
okay .
do you have your calendar for April , May , June ?
yes .
April , May and June , yes .
okay .
is there any time that is better for you ?
well , no . in June I have the most time .
do you ?
what is available ?
the seventh of June .
oh , I can &apos;t , I have an audit then .
I am going to be tied up with that .
okay .
how about the week before ?
that is just not good for me then .
the first of June ?
let us see .
you got
what about that last week of June , the twenty eighth , twenty ninth , thirtieth ?
you pick .
well , yes .
I have a soccer game , it is on the thirtieth , but I could cancel that .
and I can make a cancellation , too ,
and that would leave those three days open for me because I think we are going to need three days .
okay ,
then let us go for the twenty eighth ,
twenty ninth and thirtieth .
okay .
I have a list of the flights .
let us see .
we can it takes twelve hours to get there .
they have an express flights on Monday ,
it only takes seven hours so that sounds like that would be good if we can leave then on Monday .
yes .
they have an express flights on Monday . it only takes seven hours .
so that sounds like that would be good if we could leave then on Monday .
yeah , that
what time does that leave ?
from eight well , that is eight o &apos;clock . that is going to put us in there late .
let us see .
eight $ P- $ M ?
eight , yeah .
eight $ A- $ M .
eight $ A- $ M .
let us see .
duration of flight .
this is seven hours ,
eight ,
nine % , ten % , eleven % , twelve % , one , two , three . well , that will get us there , with the change of time and everything , about nine $ P- $ M and then we can start bright and early Tuesday morning .
yeah .
that would be all right .
that sounds all right .
okay .
now , do you have a list of where we can stay ?
yes . we have the hotel Zentral Hanover or a hotel Noehre Hanover or a hotel Prinzenhof .
okay .
now , are we going to rent a car like we did before ?
yeah . and yeah , that hotel Zentral has a parking garage if we rent a car .
okay .
or the hotel Noehre , it has parking , also .
well , why don &apos;t you if you can call and see which about prices and which
those three .
five minutes the hotel Noehre Hanover has only five minutes from central station .
well ,
if we are going to have a park we don &apos;t have to car we don &apos;t have to worry about that , except for like that evening for entertainment .
we could either go to a movie a play or just have , you know , a nice dinner .
okay .
yeah .
so that one , if it has parking and it is only five minutes from central station .
let us is the price as good on that ?
yeah , I will have to check on that .
okay .
and let us see then , we will be returning on Wednesday .
let us go with the earliest flight , which will be at four $ A- $ M .
because that we will have to go the long ,
you know .
it won &apos;t be the express flight , so it is going to take us a lot longer to get back .
yes , okay .
that will be all right .
so ,
I will try to get the earliest fight .
the first one well ,
let me see . I think eight o &apos;clock is the earliest flight ,
actually ,
from Hanover back to Pittsburgh ,
so we will go I will try to get that earliest flight then .
this hotel Noehre Hanover would be better , also , because of it has a restaurant in there .
oh , okay okay .
well , it sounds like we got those plans made and then we can just go to the restaurant and just have a nice dinner at the restaurant .
not worry about going out that night so we can get up early the next morning and leave , okay ?
dinner , yes .
that would be fine .
all right .
I will make the reservations for the flight and you can do the same with the hotel .
yes .
and I will get back with you .
I will make the hotel reservations .
okay .
thank you .
see you later .
bye bye .
okay , bye .
hello , Dan .
how are you ?
hi .
okay , Bea .
how are you today ?
all right . hey , do you have time to plan that branch meeting in Hanover , Germany ?
yeah . well , I will just take time because you we got to get it arranged .
we need to get there in the either July , August or September .
do you have your calendars for that time ?
yes .
okay .
August is no good because that is when I take my two weeks vacation .
okay .
how about in July around the third week ,
that Monday ,
Tuesday ,
Wednesday or Thursday ?
any of those days good for you ?
that is the thirteenth .
mhm .
fourteenth , fifteenth .
okay , I have a dental appointment on the thirteenth but I can cancel that .
well , are you available Tuesday , Wednesday or Thursday of that week ?
yes .
well , we could always leave on Tuesday .
it is only three days .
yeah , all right .
okay .
I have a list of the flights and we are plan on leaving Tuesday , July the fourteenth .
the flights leave every four hours starting at six o &apos;clock .
I would like to get that first flight if that is okay with you .
yeah . well , the earlier the better .
okay now we probably take we need to get there an hour before and then thirty minutes traveling time so it will be about four thirty when I pick you up .
okay .
okay and then Wednesday morning we can go out to the branch and have our meetings there .
then that evening we could either go to a show a movie or just if there is a nice restaurant around we could just stay and have a good dinner .
yeah well ,
I have a list of the hotels .
and it we there is a choice of three of them right in that area is the Maritim hotel Hanover or the hotel Luisenhof or hotel Loccumer-Hof .
but the only one that has a restaurant would be the hotel Luisenhof .
mhm .
I think that would be our best choice because the prices are all about the same .
okay .
now should we just rent a car at the airport and but then just drive out to the branch because I think it takes about an hour to get there .
I think
I think that would be better , yes .
okay , is there parking available at that hotel ?
yes .
all right .
well then I will make the reservations for the fourteenth to leave Pittsburgh and then leaving Hanover we can get a flight starting four five o &apos;clock and every four hours so .
I will try for either five or nine o &apos;clock in the morning those first two flights .
okay .
all right .
okay ?
and I will make the arrangements at hotel Luisenhof .
okay that sounds good .
for
so I will get back in touch with you and let you know if there is any changes or anything .
okay ?
all right .
okay .
that would be two nights on two nights at the hotel Luisenhof for the four fourteenth and no .
yeah .
yeah fourteenth and fifteenth .
yeah that would be fine .
yeah okay .
okay , all right . I will talk to you later .
thank you .
okay .
goodbye .
bye now .
hello , Dan . how are you ?
hi , Bea .
okay .
you know ,
we are going to have that yearly branch meeting over in Hanover Germany coming up the end of the year and we really need to make some arrangements .
do you have the time and your calendar available ?
yes , I have the calendar available .
to yeah .
okay .
I will tell you what , October doesn &apos;t look good for me at all .
what about November ?
do you have ,
let us see ,
any time available ? course with the holidays we are going to kind of be limited on our time .
but let us see .
December , how about the first week of December ?
what is what do you have going ?
well , I have a meeting on the Wednesday .
okay .
well , do you have any
an important meeting .
oh , okay .
on the second .
what about the second week ?
the seventh , eighth , ninth ?
you have anything going then at all ?
all right .
no , that would be all right . the second week of
okay , I have it .
how many days was is this going to take ?
it only takes three days .
okay .
that would be all right because
I will have a dinner I have to cancel but that is okay .
I will just have to do that .
okay . well , I have a list of the flights .
so , let us see .
should we leave that Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday ?
should we plan on those three days ?
I think that would be good or the best .
okay .
and I have my list of flights . we the earliest fight is at six thirty .
I would like to try to get that flight if possible .
let us see .
so I will try to make the arrangements for the flight six thirty for the
okay , that is for this
let us see .
December seventh , eight and ninth .
okay .
it takes us twelve hours to get there .
so if we get that early flight ,
that will give us some sleep time and then Tuesday we can go out to the branch .
that evening would you like to see a movie ?
seventh , eighth and ninth .
well , okay .
but I will have to make arrangements at a hotel .
yeah , if you would do that .
there is a we got three choices , the Marriott hotel at Hanover or the Parkhotel at Hanover or hotel Cristal Hanover .
but the best one I think would be the Parkhotel Hanover .
it has parking and they have a breakfast buffet , also .
okay , we can do that .
we will just rent the car at the airport and if that has parking at that hotel that would be good .
it is only five minutes from central station , also .
okay .
we can I will try to get a see what plays are available .
and get tickets for that and then we could just actually go on the train there .
okay .
and then we will return back on
the ninth .
Wednesday , December ninth .
those flights start at six $ A- $ M .
so , I will try to get the six o &apos;clock or ten o &apos;clock flight for that day , okay ?
okay , yeah .
all right .
well then that is what I will my I will do ,
the arrangements of the flights and I will see what play is available for us to see .
well
we could do some Christmas shopping , too , over there .
well , that would be nice .
yes , and it should be beautiful at that time of year .
it will make it a real pleasant visit , I am sure .
okay .
well , I will get back with you .
okay .
I will check on the hotel .
okay .
thank you , good bye .
bye now .
hey , Dan .
I am glad I ran into you . could you step into my office ? I thought maybe this would be a good time to check out about this business trip we are suppose to be taking .
certainly .
when is it suppose to happen ?
sometime between now and March .
today is do you have your calendar with you ?
today is January sixth .
yes , I do . okay .
and as I understand it , we are supposed to take a day or day and a half for the business meeting itself and the trip will take a total of three days ,
right ?
right .
let us see if we can coordinate this together between our calendars .
so , what three days are you available within the next couple months ?
all I have
anything this month ?
the next three days , but that is kind of short notice .
it is and I am not available within the next three days .
okay .
how about in February ?
I have a big block in February . February second through the sixth , does any of that sound good to you ?
the fourth through the sixth , yes .
the sixth is a Saturday .
do you want to return on the on a Saturday ?
that is all right with me .
all right . and you want to try to set the business the meeting itself rather for Friday , the fifth ?
so we would fly out on the fourth ?
that
that sounds good .
and I understand you have a schedule of flights . is there something available for the fourth ?
yes .
let me find that . here we go . it is daily so it doesn &apos;t matter what day of the week it is .
yeah , we can go every three hours from six $ A- $ M to seventeen thirty five in the $ P- $ M .
and I believe it takes twelve hours to get over there , right ?
once we lift off from Pittsburgh .
right .
so , that is a direct flight .
that is direct .
from Pittsburgh ?
okay .
plus ,
you are going to have to figure in your time to get from the airport to our hotel and the meeting so . you are better at these numbers than I am .
what that what time will that put us in to Pittsburgh ?
what time do you want to leave ? are you interested in leaving first thing in the morning ?
that sounds good .
you want to take the first flight at six $ A- $ M ?
let us try that one .
okay . so .
that would be like six .
that would put us in there at six $ P- $ M our time .
that gives us plenty of time to chill out before the morning .
which would be
well , it would be twelve midnight their time .
but if we go ahead and schedule a the meeting for ten o &apos;clock in the morning on the fifth ,
we could fly out on the fourth ,
arrive by midnight .
actually , we should try to schedule an afternoon meeting .
if we could schedule an afternoon meeting for two o &apos;clock , and I don &apos;t think it is a problem scheduling for two o &apos;clock ,
we should do that .
that way we could fly out at six $ A- $ M ,
get there at midnight their time .
and even given the time to get to the hotel and the check in and pick up our bags and so forth it might be two $ A- $ M . and we could sleep into the morning if we needed to and then get up ,
get refreshed , eat lunch , and then go to the two $ P- $ M meeting .
I like that .
and if the meeting lasts for an hour , even an hour and a half , or two hours then we can try to depart on say at six $ P- $ M or so on the fifth .
and then get back on a on Saturday .
okay .
what time will that put us in home because I don &apos;t want to have to call anybody up pick me up at the airport too early in the morning .
six $ P- $ M to well , let us figure it out .
six $ P- $ M to it is a twelve hour flight again so that will put us in at six $ A- $ M Hanover time and they are six hours ahead of us so it would actually be twelve noon on Saturday .
I think I can get a ride at that time of the day .
okay .
now last thing to decide then is where do we want to stay ?
yes .
did you get a list of the hotels like we talked about ?
because I
it just so happens that I do have a list of the hotels that we are talking about .
hotel Royal Hanover which is in the center city .
there is a cafeteria and a parking garage which we really don &apos;t care about because we are not going to have a vehicle .
or there is the Schlosshotel Hanover which is five minutes from central city .
and there is the hotel at Georgengarten which is also in the central city .
and they have a swimming pool .
and they have a swimming pool .
well , do you care about that ?
the Schlosshotel also has a bar and a restaurant .
which is a little bit more well , both
probably wouldn &apos;t have time to use the swimming pool .
both the Schlosshotel and the hotel at Georgengarten would be better because they have a restaurant and a bar .
yeah .
so , we wouldn &apos;t have to go out to eat .
sounds good .
and the Schlosshotel is cheaper although it is five minutes out .
but it is considerably cheaper than the hotel at Georgengarten .
well ,
what fifty Euros or so roughly for single rooms .
actually we should get two double rooms because they are cheaper and it is considerably cheaper than the Georgengarten so we should go for the Schlosshotel .
okay .
save the company a few dollars , that sounds good .
even if it does cost for taxi fare . right .
okay , sounds like a plan .
so ,
we will leave again on the fourth of February at six $ A- $ M from Pittsburgh .
and be back by noon on Saturday .
and we will stay at the Schlosshotel , right ?
okay .
think you are going to have any energy to do anything in the evening while we are there ?
we have Friday evening , that is a good time to go out .
okay .
probably no we won &apos;t have time to go out to eat Friday evening because we are departing around six .
what do we do ?
okay .
but we can hit the bar before we go and or the restaurant to get something to eat before we go to airport .
okay .
all right ?
all right .
okay .
I will see you later then and then we can talk see each other again and talk about the fourth .
okay .
thanks , Dan .
you are welcome .
bye , Connie .
Colleen ,
excuse me .
hey ,
you have a few minutes we can discuss this business trip that we are supposed to have setup and have in Hanover ?
sure , Dan .
want to step into your office since we are standing right outside of it ?
okay .
you want to bring your appointment book in with you and we can go over this .
it just so happens that I have it with me . as I understand it , we are just going to fly over .
actually , we are going to schedule a meeting .
it is pretty much up to us as far as what time we set up the meeting .
so ,
we will fly over and conduct the meeting and if we can squeeze something in the evening ,
we will do that and then return .
so , I think it will take probably three days to do .
so , in the next couple months , do you have a three day period that is available ?
not too many but maybe something here will
anything this month ?
be good for you .
how about the
no .
unless we go later this week and come back on a Saturday .
how is the eighth , ninth , tenth on your calendar ?
well ,
I scheduled a meeting for I mean , actually I scheduled to donate blood on the eighth at three $ P- $ M .
you wouldn &apos;t want to miss that , huh ?
so if we can reschedule ,
I mean ,
if we can pick another time ,
I would rather do that than rescheduling it .
okay .
so , do you have any other three day period available ?
not in April .
how does your May look ?
I have
I have nothing .
twenty fifth , twenty sixth , twenty seventh ?
my parents &apos; anniversary party is on the twenty seventh .
okay .
and I don &apos;t want to miss that .
and my in-laws are coming right after that , so I probably better stick around and get prepared for that .
what about June ?
twenty first , twenty second and twenty third is just about the only time I could do that .
I have a conference scheduled in Boston which I really can &apos;t skip .
well , any other time .
well , I maybe I will have to rearrange the schedule .
so
how about in June ?
seventh , eighth and ninth or tenth ?
I have an important audit meeting during the seventh , eighth and ninth .
so , that won &apos;t work .
but directly after that I could cancel my Friday appointment .
tenth ,
eleventh and twelfth ?
come back on a Saturday or did you want to make this on weekdays ?
how about how
I have a dinner party scheduled for the for Friday .
okay .
how
well , was there anything we could rearrange in May ?
we didn &apos;t try to meet in
okay .
what did you say about the next couple days in April here ?
like the eight thing . seventh , eighth , ninth and tenth ?
eighth , ninth and tenth .
I was suppose to give blood on the eighth but why don &apos;t we plan on doing it the eighth , ninth and tenth ?
okay .
and I will skip that and
you can probably reschedule that pretty easy , huh ?
so , we would depart on the eighth ?
and arrive on or conduct have the business meeting scheduled for Friday and then return on Saturday ?
yes , I can do that .
okay .
what do you have the schedule for flights ?
yes , right here .
there are flights into Hanover every four hours from four $ A- $ M to
to eight o &apos;clock ?
twenty .
eight o &apos;clock ?
okay , thank you .
yes .
are you interested in leaving at four $ A- $ M ?
let us say .
four hours after that is eight .
how about eight $ A- $ M ?
we are going to hit all the business people at that time , though .
that is right .
that is why I was thinking about the four $ A- $ M flight .
seats might be more available .
and get us in at four $ P- $ M .
and there is a time difference .
I believe there is a six hour time difference .
right ? so get us in at they are six hours ahead of us , so
here we have express flights .
ten .
it would be ten $ P- $ M their time .
we are not leaving on a Monday , though . can &apos;t do the express .
no .
so , we would get in at ten $ P- $ M their time .
we could get a hotel ,
get up the next day and maybe have the meeting scheduled for maybe we can schedule the meeting for eleven o &apos;clock and do it over lunch .
a lunch meeting .
that would be nice .
yep . I know we could finish it by one and either do something that afternoon or fly back home .
we cut it short last time and since we are giving up a Saturday anyway , let us do something fun Friday .
did you get the hotel information that we requested ?
as a matter of fact ,
I did . there are actually three hotels .
one is near the train station ,
which I assume is in downtown Hanover ,
one is five miles from central station and one is at the central station .
so ,
the first one ,
which is the hotel Zentral Hanover ,
has a parking garage and non smoking floors .
there is the hotel Noehre Hanover which has a restaurant ,
sauna and parking .
and then there is a hotel Prinzenhof which has bistro , video , a weight room and a sauna .
okay .
since we are getting in so late ,
let us get this hotel Prinzenhof because it is going to be real close to where we need to be .
okay .
it is more expensive .
but that is okay ,
company is footing the bill so and we can get two double rooms . they also have a bistro there ,
hopefully it will be open when we get in . and then again we will maybe we could try to see a movie or a play that night if there is something available close by .
that would be a good way to relax after that business meeting .
or we could just go to a restaurant and have a nice dinner .
and then what time the departures from Hanover ?
the last flight is twenty three thirty five , it would be about eleven thirty five then any
do we want to do that or why don &apos;t we actually wait until the next morning ?
let us go out on Saturday .
and get the flight .
and get the flight back at Saturday morning , eight o &apos;clock .
no need to give up our sleep , I never could sleep on the plane .
okay .
then we can pick one up at eight $ A- $ M or twelve noon . let us get the eight $ A- $ M one .
let us
let us make it eight $ A- $ M .
okay .
all right , we will try to make those reservations .
and that will get us in
eight $ P- $ M Hanover time and two $ P- $ M Pittsburgh time .
okay .
I will handle the plane reservations if you want to call and make
no , that is not right .
yeah , we will work out the hours later .
okay .
okay .
you can call for the hotel reservations then .
right , I will take care of that then .
all right .
okay , talk to you later .
all right .
good bye .
thanks , bye .
